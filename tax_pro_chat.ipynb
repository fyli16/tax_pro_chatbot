For 2024, you will use Form 1040 or, if you were born before January 2, 1960, you have the option to use Form 1040-SR. You may only need to ﬁle Form 1040 or 1040-SR and none of the numbered schedules, Schedules 1 through 3. However, if your return is more complicated (for example, you claim certain deductions or credits or owe additional taxes), you will need to complete one or more of the numbered schedules. Below is a general guide to which schedule(s) you will need to ﬁle based on your circumstances. See the instructions for the schedules for more information. If you e-ﬁle your return, the software you use will generally determine which schedules you need. Form 1040 and 1040-SR Helpful Hints 3 The Taxpayer Advocate Service Is Here To Help You What is the Taxpayer Advocate Service? The Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) is an independent organization within the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that helps taxpayers and protects taxpayer rights. TAS strives to ensure that every taxpayer is treated fairly and that you know and understand your rights under the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. What can TAS do for you? TAS can help you if your tax problem is causing a financial difficulty, you've tried and been unable to resolve your issue with the IRS, or you believe an IRS system, process, or procedure just isn't working as it should. And the service is free. If you qualify for TAS assistance, you will be assigned to one advocate who will work with you throughout the process and will do everything possible to resolve your issue. TAS can help you if: • Your problem is causing a financial difficulty for you, your family, or your business. • You face (or your business is facing) an immediate threat of adverse action. • You’ve tried to contact the IRS but no one has responded, or the IRS hasn’t responded by the date promised. How can you reach TAS? TAS has offices in every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. To find your advocate’s number: • Go to TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov/contact-us; • Download Publication 1546, Taxpayer Advocate Service Is Your Voice at the IRS. If you do not have Internet access, you can call the IRS toll free at 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676) and ask for a copy of Publication 1546; • Check your local directory; or • Call TAS toll free at 877-777-4778. How can you learn about your taxpayer rights? The Taxpayer Bill of Rights describes 10 basic rights that all taxpayers have when dealing with the IRS. The TAS website TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov can help you understand what these rights mean to you and how they apply. These are your rights. Know them. Use them. How else does TAS help taxpayers? TAS works to resolve large-scale problems that affect many taxpayers. If you know of one of these broad issues, please report it to TAS at IRS.gov/SAMS. Be sure not to include any personal taxpayer information. Low Income Taxpayer Clinics Help Taxpayers Low Income Taxpayer Clinics (LITCs) are independent from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS). LITCs represent individuals whose income is below a certain level and who need to resolve tax problems with the IRS. LITCs can represent taxpayers in audits, appeals, and tax collection disputes before the IRS and in court. In addition, LITCs can provide information about taxpayer rights and responsibilities in different languages for individuals who speak English as a second language. Services are offered for free or a small fee. For more information or to find an LITC near you, see the LITC page at TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov/LITCMap or IRS Publication 4134, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic List. This publication is available online at IRS.gov/Forms-Pubs or by calling the IRS toll free at 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676). Suggestions for Improving the IRS Taxpayer Advocacy Panel Taxpayers have an opportunity to provide direct feedback to the IRS through the Taxpayer Advocacy Panel (TAP). The TAP is a Federal Advisory Committee comprised of an independent panel of citizen volunteers who listen to taxpayers, identify taxpayers' systemic issues, and make suggestions for improving IRS customer service. Contact TAP at ImproveIRS.org. 4 Affordable Care Act—What You Need To Know Requirement To Reconcile Advance Payments of the Premium Tax Credit The premium tax credit helps pay premiums for health insurance purchased from the Health Insurance Marketplace (the Marketplace). Eligible individuals may have advance payments of the premium tax credit made on their behalf directly to the insurance company. If you or a family member enrolled in health insurance through the Marketplace and advance payments of the premium tax credit were made to your insurance company to reduce your monthly premium payment, you must attach Form 8962 to your return to reconcile (compare) the advance payments with your premium tax credit for the year. The Marketplace is required to send Form 1095-A by January 31, 2025, listing the advance payments and other information you need to complete Form 8962. 1. You will need Form 1095-A from the Marketplace. 2. Complete Form 8962 to claim the credit and to reconcile your advance credit payments. 3. Include Form 8962 with your Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. (Don’t include Form 1095-A.) Health Coverage Reporting If you or someone in your family was an employee in 2024, the employer may be required to send you Form 1095-C. Part II of Form 1095-C shows whether your employer offered you health insurance coverage and, if so, information about the offer. You should receive Form 1095-C by early March 2025. This information may be relevant if you purchased health insurance coverage for 2024 through the Marketplace and wish to claim the premium tax credit on Schedule 3, line 9. However, you don’t need to wait to receive this form to file your return. You may rely on other information received from your employer. If you don’t wish to claim the premium tax credit for 2024, you don’t need the information in Part II of Form 1095-C. For more information on who is eligible for the premium tax credit, see the Instructions for Form 8962. Reminder: Health care coverage. If you need health care coverage, go to www.HealthCare.gov to learn about health insurance options for you and your family, how to buy health insurance, and how you might qualify to get ﬁnancial assistance to buy health insurance. 5 What's New For information about any additional changes to the 2024 tax law or any other devel- opments affecting Form 1040 or 1040-SR or the instructions, go to IRS.gov/ Form1040.

FREE WAYS To File Your Taxes 7 Filing Requirements These rules apply to all U.S. citizens, regardless of where they live, and resident ali- ens. Have you tried IRS e-file? It's the fastest way to get your refund and it's free if you are eligible. Visit IRS.gov for details. Do You Have To File? Use Chart A, B, or C to see if you must file a return. U.S. citizens who lived in or had income from a U.S. territory should see Pub. 570. Residents of Puerto Rico can use Tax Topic 901 to see if they must file. Even if you do not otherwise have to file a return, you should file one to get a refund of any federal income tax withheld. You should also file if you are eligible for any of the following credits. • Earned income credit. • Additional child tax credit. • American opportunity credit. • Premium tax credit. See Pub. 501 for details. Also see Pub. 501 if you do not have to file but received a Form 1099-B (or substitute statement). Requirement to reconcile advance payments of the premium tax credit. If you, your spouse with whom you are filing a joint return, or a dependent was enrolled in coverage through the Mar- ketplace for 2024 and advance payments of the premium tax credit were made for this coverage, you must file a 2024 re- turn and attach Form 8962. You (or whoever enrolled you) should have re- ceived Form 1095-A from the Market- place with information about your cov- erage and any advance payments. You must attach Form 8962 even if someone else enrolled you, your spouse, or your dependent. If you are a depend- ent who is claimed on someone else's 2024 return, you do not have to attach Form 8962. Exception for certain children under age 19 or full-time students. If certain conditions apply, you can elect to in- clude on your return the income of a child who was under age 19 at the end of 2024 or was a full-time student under age 24 at the end of 2024. To do so, use Form 8814. If you make this election, TIP your child doesn't have to file a return. For details, use Tax Topic 553 or see Form 8814. A child born on January 1, 2001, is considered to be age 24 at the end of 2024. Do not use Form 8814 for such a child. Resident aliens. These rules also apply if you were a resident alien. Also, you may qualify for certain tax treaty bene- fits. Generally, you are a resident alien if you meet either the green card test or the substantial presence test for 2024. See Pub. 519 for details. Nonresident aliens and dual-status ali- ens. These rules also apply if you were a nonresident alien or a dual-status alien and both of the following apply. • You were married to a U.S. citizen or resident alien at the end of 2024. • You elected to be taxed as a resi- dent alien. For more information, see Nonresident aliens and dual-status aliens, later, and Pub. 519. Specific rules apply to deter- mine if you are a resident alien, nonresident alien, or dual-sta- tus alien. Most nonresident aliens and dual-status aliens have different filing requirements and may have to file Form 1040-NR. Pub. 519 discusses these re- quirements and other information to help aliens comply with U.S. tax law. When and Where Should You File? File Form 1040 or 1040-SR by April 15, 2025. If you file after this date, you may have to pay interest and penalties. See Interest and Penalties, later. If you were serving in, or in support of, the U.S. Armed Forces in a designa- ted combat zone or contingency opera- tion, you may be able to file later. See Pub. 3 for details. CAUTION ! If you e-file your return, there is no need to mail it. However, if you choose to mail it instead, filing instructions and addresses are at the end of these instruc- tions. The chart at the end of these in- structions provides the current address for mailing your return. Use these addresses for Forms 1040 or 1040-SR filed in 2025. The address for returns filed after 2025 may be different. See IRS.gov/Form1040 for any updates. What if You Can't File on Time? You can get an automatic 6-month ex- tension if, no later than the date your re- turn is due, you file Form 4868. If you want to apply for an extension electroni- cally, see Form 4868 for details. An automatic 6-month exten- sion to file doesn't extend the time to pay your tax. If you don’t pay your tax by the original due date of your return, you will owe interest on the unpaid tax and may owe penal- ties. See Form 4868. If you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien, you may qualify for an automatic extension of time to file without filing Form 4868. You qualify if, on the due date of your return, you meet one of the following conditions. • You live outside the United States and Puerto Rico and your main place of business or post of duty is outside the United States and Puerto Rico. • You are in military or naval service on duty outside the United States and Puerto Rico. This extension gives you an extra 2 months to file and pay the tax, but inter- est will be charged from the original due date of the return on any unpaid tax. You must include a statement showing that you meet the requirements. If you are still unable to file your return by the end of the 2-month period, you can get an additional 4 months if, no later than June 16, 2025, you file Form 4868. This TIP CAUTION ! 8 4-month extension of time to file doesn't extend the time to pay your tax. See Form 4868.

See Form 8936 and Schedule A (Form 8936). Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. 11 Line Instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR Also see the instructions for Schedule 1 through Schedule 3 that follow the Form 1040 and 1040-SR instructions. What form to file. Everyone can file Form 1040. Form 1040-SR is available to you if you were born before January 2, 1960. Fiscal year filers. If you are a fiscal year filer using a tax year other than January 1 through December 31, 2024, enter the beginning and ending months of your fiscal year in the entry space provided at the top of page 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Write-in information. If you need to write a word, code, and/or dollar amount on Form 1040 or 1040-SR to explain an item of income or deduction, but don't have enough space to enter the word, code, and/or dollar amount, you can put an asterisk next to the applicable line number and put a footnote at the bottom of page 2 of your tax return indicating the line number and the word, code, and/or dollar amount you need to enter. Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code. CAUTION ! Name and Address Print or type the information in the spaces provided. If you are married fil- ing a separate return, enter your spouse's name in the entry space below the filing status checkboxes instead of below your name. If you are currently incarcerated, enter your inmate identifying number near your last name. If you filed a joint return for 2023 and you are filing a joint return for 2024 with the same spouse, be sure to enter your names and SSNs in the same order as on your 2023 return. Name Change If you changed your name because of marriage, divorce, etc., be sure to report the change to the Social Security Ad- ministration (SSA) before filing your re- turn. This prevents delays in processing your return and issuing refunds. It also safeguards your future social security benefits. Address Change If you plan to move after filing your re- turn, use Form 8822 to notify the IRS of your new address. P.O. Box Enter your box number only if your post office doesn't deliver mail to your home. Foreign Address If you have a foreign address, enter the city name on the appropriate line. Don’t TIP enter any other information on that line, but also complete the spaces below that line. Don’t abbreviate the country name. Follow the country’s practice for enter- ing the postal code and the name of the province, county, or state. Death of a Taxpayer If a taxpayer died before filing a return for 2024, the taxpayer's spouse or per- sonal representative may have to file and sign a return for that taxpayer. A person- al representative can be an executor, ad- ministrator, or anyone who is in charge of the deceased taxpayer's property. If the deceased taxpayer didn't have to file a return but had tax withheld, a return must be filed to get a refund. The person who files the return must enter “De- ceased,” the deceased taxpayer's name, and the date of death across the top of the return. If this information isn't provi- ded, it may delay the processing of the return. If your spouse died in 2024 and you didn't remarry in 2024, or if your spouse died in 2025 before filing a return for 2024, you can file a joint return. A joint return should show your spouse's 2024 income before death and your income for all of 2024. Enter “Filing as surviv- ing spouse” in the area where you sign the return. If someone else is the person- al representative, they must also sign. All payers of income, including fi- nancial institutions, should be promptly notified of the taxpayer's death. This will ensure the proper reporting of in- come earned by the taxpayer's estate or heirs. A deceased taxpayer's social se- curity number shouldn't be used for tax years after the year of death, except for estate tax return purposes. Social Security Number (SSN) An incorrect or missing SSN can in- crease your tax, reduce your refund, or delay your refund. To apply for an SSN, fill in Form SS-5 and return it, along with the appropriate evidence docu- ments, to the Social Security Adminis- tration (SSA). You can get Form SS-5 online at SSA.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf, from your local SSA office, or by calling the SSA at 800-772-1213. It usually takes about 2 weeks to get an SSN once the SSA has all the evidence and informa- tion it needs. Check that both the name and SSN on your Forms 1040 or 1040-SR, W-2, and 1099 agree with your social security card. If they don’t, certain deductions and credits on Form 1040 or 1040-SR may be reduced or disallowed and you may not receive credit for your social security earnings. If your Form W-2 shows an incorrect SSN or name, notify your employer or the form-issuing agent as soon as possible to make sure your earnings are credited to your social se- curity record. If the name or SSN on your social security card is incorrect, call the SSA. Once you are issued an SSN, use it to file your tax return. Use your SSN to file your tax return even if your SSN does not authorize employment or if you have been issued an SSN that authorizes em- 12 Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. ployment and you lose your employ- ment authorization. An ITIN won’t be issued to you once you have been issued an SSN. If you received your SSN after previously using an ITIN, stop using your ITIN. Use your SSN instead. IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) for Aliens If you are a nonresident or resident alien and you don’t have and aren’t eligible to get an SSN, you must apply for an ITIN. It takes about 7 weeks to get an ITIN. If you already have an ITIN, enter it wherever your SSN is requested on your tax return. Some ITINs must be renewed. If you haven't used your ITIN on a federal tax return at least once for tax years 2021, 2022, or 2023, it has expired and must be renewed if you need to file a federal tax return. You don't need to renew your ITIN if you don't need to file a federal tax return. You can find more informa- tion at IRS.gov/ITIN. An ITIN is for tax use only. It doesn't entitle you to social security benefits or change your employment or immigra- tion status under U.S. law. For more information on ITINs, in- cluding application, expiration, and re- newal, see Form W-7 and its instruc- tions. If you receive an SSN after previous- ly using an ITIN, stop using your ITIN. Use your SSN instead. Visit a local IRS office or write a letter to the IRS ex- plaining that you now have an SSN and want all your tax records combined un- der your SSN. Details about what to in- clude with the letter and where to mail it are at IRS.gov/ITIN. Nonresident Alien Spouse If your spouse is a nonresident alien, your spouse must have either an SSN or an ITIN if: • You file a joint return, or • Your spouse is filing a separate re- turn. Presidential Election Campaign Fund This fund helps pay for Presidential election campaigns. The fund reduces candidates' dependence on large contri- butions from individuals and groups and places candidates on an equal financial footing in the general election. The fund also helps pay for pediatric medical re- search. If you want $3 to go to this fund, check the box. If you are filing a joint return, your spouse can also have $3 go to the fund. If you check a box, your tax or refund won't change. Filing Status Check only the filing status that applies to you. The ones that will usually give you the lowest tax are listed last. • Married filing separately. • Single. • Head of household. • Married filing jointly. • Qualifying surviving spouse. For information about marital status, see Pub. 501. More than one filing status can apply to you. You can choose the one for which you qualify that will give you the lowest tax. Single You can check the “Single” box in the Filing Status section on page 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR if any of the following was true on December 31, 2024. • You were never married. • You were legally separated accord- ing to your state law under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance. But if, at the end of 2024, your divorce wasn't final (an interlocutory decree), you are considered married and can't check the box. • You were widowed before January 1, 2024, and didn't remarry before the end of 2024. But if you have a child, you may be able to use the qualifying surviving spouse filing status. See the instructions for Qualifying Surviving Spouse, later. Married Filing Jointly You can check the “Married filing joint- ly” box in the Filing Status section on page 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR if any of the following apply. • You were married at the end of 2024, even if you didn't live with your spouse at the end of 2024. • Your spouse died in 2024 and you didn't remarry in 2024. TIP • You were married at the end of 2024 and your spouse died in 2025 be- fore filing a 2024 return. A married couple filing jointly report their combined income and deduct their combined allowable expenses on one re- turn. They can file a joint return even if only one had income or if they didn't live together all year. However, both persons must sign the return. Once you file a joint return, you can't choose to file separate returns for that year after the due date of the return. Joint and several tax liability. If you file a joint return, both you and your spouse are generally responsible for the tax and interest or penalties due on the return. This means that if one spouse doesn't pay the tax due, the other may have to. Or, if one spouse doesn't report the correct tax, both spouses may be re- sponsible for any additional taxes as- sessed by the IRS. You may want to file separately if: • You believe your spouse isn't re- porting all of their income, or • You don’t want to be responsible for any taxes due if your spouse doesn't have enough tax withheld or doesn't pay enough estimated tax. See the instructions for Married Filing Separately. Also see Innocent Spouse Relief under General Information, later. Nonresident aliens and dual-status ali- ens. Generally, a married couple can't file a joint return if either spouse is a nonresident alien at any time during the year. However, you and your spouse can choose to be treated as U.S. residents for the entire year and file a joint return if one spouse was a nonresident alien at the end of the taxable year (the nonresi- dent spouse) and the other was a U.S. citizen or resident at the end of the taxa- ble year. This choice remains in effect in subsequent years until terminated. You and your spouse can also choose to file as U.S. residents for the entire year if both of you are U.S. citizens or residents at the end of the year and either (or both) of you were a nonresident at the beginning of the year (the dual-status spouse(s)). You can only make this choice for 1 year, and it does not apply to any future years. If you and your spouse are making ei- ther of these choices to be treated as U.S. residents for 2024, check the box in the Filing Status section and enter the Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. 13 name of the nonresident spouse or du- al-status spouse(s) (whichever applies to you) in the entry space. Also check the box and enter their name if you and your nonresident spouse made the choice to be treated as residents in a prior year and the choice remains in effect. To make either choice for 2024, you and your spouse must file a joint return and attach a state- ment, signed by both spouses, to your re- turn. To find out what information must be included in the statement, as well as more information on these choices, see Nonresident Spouse Treated as a Resi- dent for nonresident aliens and Choos- ing Resident Alien Status for dual-status aliens in Pub. 519. Married Filing Separately Check the “Married filing separately” box in the Filing Status section on page 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR if you are married, at the end of 2024, and file a separate return. Enter your spouse’s name in the entry space below the filing status checkboxes. Be sure to enter your spouse’s SSN or ITIN in the space for spouse’s SSN on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If your spouse doesn’t have and isn’t required to have an SSN or ITIN, enter “NRA” in the entry space below the filing status checkboxes. For electronic filing, enter the spou- se's name or “NRA” if the spouse doesn’t have an SSN or ITIN in the en- try space below the filing status check- boxes. If you are married and file a separate return, you generally report only your own income, deductions, and credits. Generally, you are responsible only for the tax on your own income. Different rules apply to people in community property states; see Pub. 555. However, you will usually pay more tax than if you use another filing status for which you qualify. Also, if you file a separate return, you can't take the stu- dent loan interest deduction or the edu- cation credits, and you will only be able to take the earned income credit and child and dependent care credit in very limited circumstances. You also can't take the standard deduction if your spouse itemizes deductions. For situa- tions when you might want to file sepa- rately, see Joint and several tax liability, earlier. CAUTION ! You may be able to file as head of household if you had a child living with you and you lived apart from your spouse during the last 6 months of 2024. See Married persons who live apart, later. Head of Household You can check the “Head of household” box in the Filing Status section on page 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR if you are unmarried and provide a home for certain other persons. You are consid- ered unmarried for this purpose if any of the following applies. • You were legally separated accord- ing to your state law under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance at the end of 2024. But if, at the end of 2024, your divorce wasn't final (an interlocuto- ry decree), you are considered married. • You are married but lived apart from your spouse for the last 6 months of 2024 and you meet the other rules un- der Married persons who live apart, lat- er. • You are married and your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time dur- ing the year and the election to treat the alien spouse as a resident alien is not made. See Nonresident aliens and du- al-status aliens, earlier. Check the “Head of household” box on- ly if you are unmarried (or considered unmarried) and either Test 1 or Test 2 applies. Test 1. You paid over half the cost of keeping up a home that was the main home for all of 2024 of your parent whom you can claim as a dependent, ex- cept under a multiple support agreement (see Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, later). Your parent didn't have to live with you. Test 2. You paid over half the cost of keeping up a home in which you lived and in which one of the following also lived for more than half of the year (if half or less, see Exception to time lived with you, later). 1. Any person whom you can claim as a dependent. But don’t include: a. Your child whom you claim as your dependent because of the rule for Children of divorced or separated pa- rents under Who Qualifies as Your De- pendent, later; TIP b. Any person who is your depend- ent only because the person lived with you for all of 2024; or c. Any person you claimed as a de- pendent under a multiple support agree- ment. See Who Qualifies as Your De- pendent, later. 2. Your unmarried qualifying child who isn't your dependent. 3. Your married qualifying child who isn't your dependent only because you can be claimed as a dependent on someone else's 2024 return. 4. Your qualifying child who, even though you are the custodial parent, isn't your dependent because of the rule for Children of divorced or separated pa- rents under Who Qualifies as Your De- pendent, later. If the child isn't claimed as your de- pendent, enter the child's name in the en- try space below the filing status check- boxes. If you don’t enter the name, it will take us longer to process your re- turn. Qualifying child. To find out if some- one is your qualifying child, see Step 1 under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, later. Dependent. To find out if someone is your dependent, see Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, later. The dependents you claim are those you list by name and SSN in the Dependents section on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Exception to time lived with you. Temporary absences by you or the other person for special circumstances, such as school, vacation, business, medical care, military service, or detention in a juvenile facility, count as time lived in the home. Also see Kidnapped child, lat- er, under Who Qualifies as Your De- pendent, if applicable. If the person for whom you kept up a home was born or died in 2024, you still may be able to file as head of household. If the person is your qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the part of the year the child was alive. If the person is anyone else, see Pub. 501. Similarly, if you adopted the person for whom you kept up a home in 2024, the person was lawfully placed with you for legal adoption by TIP 14 Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. you in 2024, or the person was an eligi- ble foster child placed with you during 2024, the person is considered to have lived with you for more than half of 2024 if your main home was this per- son’s main home for more than half the time since the person was adopted or placed with you in 2024. Keeping up a home. To find out what is included in the cost of keeping up a home, see Pub. 501. Married persons who live apart. Even if you weren’t divorced or legally sepa- rated at the end of 2024, you are consid- ered unmarried if all of the following apply. • You lived apart from your spouse for the last 6 months of 2024. Tempora- ry absences for special circumstances, such as for business, medical care, school, or military service, count as time lived in the home. • You file a separate return from your spouse. • You paid over half the cost of keeping up your home for 2024. • Your home was the main home of your child, stepchild, or foster child for more than half of 2024 (if half or less, see Exception to time lived with you, earlier). • You can claim this child as your dependent or could claim the child ex- cept that the child's other parent can claim the child under the rule for Chil- dren of divorced or separated parents under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, later. Adopted child. An adopted child is always treated as your own child. An adopted child includes a child lawfully placed with you for legal adoption. Foster child. A foster child is any child placed with you by an authorized placement agency or by judgment, de- cree, or other order of any court of com- petent jurisdiction. Qualifying Surviving Spouse You can check the “Qualifying surviving spouse” box in the Filing Status section on page 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR and use joint return tax rates for 2024 if all of the following apply. 1. Your spouse died in 2022 or 2023 and you didn't remarry before the end of 2024. 2. You have a child or stepchild (not a foster child) whom you can claim as a dependent or could claim as a dependent except that, for 2024: a. The child had gross income of $5,050 or more, b. The child filed a joint return, or c. You could be claimed as a de- pendent on someone else’s return. If the child isn’t claimed as your de- pendent, enter the child’s name in the entry space below the filing status checkboxes. If you don’t enter the name, it will take us longer to process your re- turn. 3. This child lived in your home for all of 2024.

You could have filed a joint re- turn with your spouse the year your spouse died, even if you didn't actually do so. If your spouse died in 2024, you can't file as qualifying surviving spouse. In- stead, see the instructions for Married Filing Jointly, earlier. Adopted child. An adopted child is al- ways treated as your own child. An adopted child includes a child lawfully placed with you for legal adoption. Dependent. To find out if someone is your dependent, see Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, later. The dependents you claim are those you list by name and SSN in the Dependents section on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Exception to time lived with you. Temporary absences by you or the child for special circumstances, such as school, vacation, business, medical care, military service, or detention in a juve- nile facility, count as time lived in the home. Also see Kidnapped child, later, under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, if applicable. A child is considered to have lived with you for all of 2024 if the child was born or died in 2024 and your home was the child's home for the entire time the child was alive. Similarly, if you adop- ted the child in 2024, or the child was lawfully placed with you for legal adop- TIP tion by you in 2024, the child is consid- ered to have lived with you for all of 2024 if your main home was this child's main home for the entire time since the child was adopted or placed with you in 2024. Keeping up a home. To find out what is included in the cost of keeping up a home, see Pub. 501. Digital Assets Digital assets are any digital representa- tions of value that are recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology. For ex- ample, digital assets include non-fungi- ble tokens (NFTs) and virtual currencies, such as cryptocurrencies and stable- coins. If a particular asset has the char- acteristics of a digital asset, it will be treated as a digital asset for federal in- come tax purposes. Check the “Yes” box next to the question on digital assets on page 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR if at any time during 2024, you (a) received (as a re- ward, award, or payment for property or services); or (b) sold, exchanged, or oth- erwise disposed of a digital asset (or any financial interest in any digital asset). For example, check “Yes” if at any time during 2024 you: • Received digital assets as payment for property or services provided; • Received digital assets as a result of a reward or award; • Received new digital assets as a result of mining, staking, and similar ac- tivities; • Received digital assets as a result of a hard fork; • Disposed of digital assets in ex- change for property or services; • Disposed of a digital asset in ex- change or trade for another digital asset; • Sold a digital asset; or • Otherwise disposed of any other fi- nancial interest in a digital asset. You have a financial interest in a dig- ital asset if you are the owner of record of a digital asset, or have an ownership stake in an account that holds one or more digital assets, including the rights and obligations to acquire a financial in- terest, or you own a wallet that holds digital assets. The following actions or transactions in 2024, alone, generally don’t require you to check “Yes”: Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. 15 • Holding a digital asset in a wallet or account; • Transferring a digital asset from one wallet or account you own or con- trol to another wallet or account that you own or control; or • Purchasing digital assets using U.S. or other real currency, including through the use of electronic platforms such as PayPal and Venmo. Do not leave the question unan- swered. You must answer “Yes” or “No” by checking the appro- priate box. For more information, go to IRS.gov/VirtualCurrencyFAQs. How To Report Digital Asset Transactions If, in 2024, you disposed of any digital asset, which you held as a capital asset, through a sale, trade, exchange, pay- ment, or other transfer, check “Yes” and use Form 8949 to calculate your capital gain or loss and report that gain or loss on Schedule D (Form 1040). If you received any digital asset as compensation for services or disposed of any digital asset that you held for sale to customers in a trade or business, you must report the income as you would re- port other income of the same type (for example, W-2 wages on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1a, or inventory or serv- ices on Schedule C). If you received ordinary income in connection with digital assets that isn't reported elsewhere on your return, see the instructions for Schedule 1, line 8v. If you disposed of any digital asset by gift, you may be required to file Form 709. See Who Must File and Transfers Subject to the Gift Tax in the Instructions for Form 709 for more information. Standard Deduction If you are filing Form 1040-SR, you can find a Standard Deduc- tion Chart on the last page of that form. Don’t file the Standard De- duction Chart with your return. CAUTION ! TIP Single and Married Filing Jointly If you or your spouse (if you are married and filing a joint return) can be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s return, check the appropriate box in the Stand- ard Deduction section. If you are married and file a joint re- turn, you can be claimed as a dependent on someone else's return if you file the joint return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid. If you were a dual-status alien, check the “Spouse itemizes on a separate re- turn or you were a dual-status alien” box. If you were a dual-status alien and you file a joint return with your spouse who was a U.S. citizen or resident alien at the end of 2024 and you and your spouse agree to be taxed on your com- bined worldwide income, don’t check the box. See Nonresident aliens and du- al-status aliens, earlier, for more infor- mation on making the election for you and your spouse to be taxed on your combined worldwide income. Age/Blindness If you or your spouse (if you are married and filing a joint return) were born be- fore January 2, 1960, or were blind at the end of 2024, check the appropriate boxes on the line labeled “Age/Blind- ness.” Don’t check any boxes for your spouse if your filing status is head of household. Death of spouse in 2024. If your spouse was born before January 2, 1960, but died in 2024 before reaching age 65, don’t check the box that says “Spouse was born before January 2, 1960.” A person is considered to reach age 65 on the day before the person’s 65th birthday. Example. Your spouse was born on February 14, 1959, and died on February 13, 2024. Your spouse is considered age 65 at the time of death. Check the appro- priate box for your spouse. However, if your spouse died on February 12, 2024, your spouse isn't considered age 65. Don’t check the box. Death of taxpayer in 2024. If you are preparing a return for someone who died in 2024, see Pub. 501 before completing the standard deduction information. Blindness If you weren’t totally blind as of Decem- ber 31, 2024, you must get a statement certified by your eye doctor (ophthal- mologist or optometrist) that: • You can't see better than 20/200 in your better eye with glasses or contact lenses, or • Your field of vision is 20 degrees or less. If your eye condition isn't likely to improve beyond the conditions listed above, you can get a statement certified by your eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) to this effect instead. You must keep the statement for your re- cords. If you receive a notice or letter but you would prefer to have it in Braille or large print, you can use Form 9000, Al- ternative Media Preference, to request notices in an alternative format includ- ing Braille, large print, audio, or elec- tronic. You can attach Form 9000 to your return or mail it separately. • You can download, or view online, tax forms and publications in a variety of formats including text-only, Braille ready files, browser-friendly HTML (other than tax forms), accessible PDF, and large print. Married Filing Separately If your filing status is married filing sep- arately and your spouse itemizes deduc- tions on their return, check the “Spouse itemizes on a separate return or you were a dual-status alien” box. If your filing status is married filing separately and your spouse was born be- fore January 2, 1960, or was blind at the end of 2024, you can check the appro- priate box(es) on the line labeled “Age/ Blindness” if your spouse had no in- come, isn't filing a return, and can't be claimed as a dependent on another per- son's return. 16 Need more information or forms?

Who Qualifies as Your Dependent Dependents, Qualifying Child for Child Tax Credit, and Credit for Other Dependents Follow the steps below to find out if a person qualifies as your dependent and to find out if your dependent qualifies you to take the child tax credit or the credit for other dependents. If you have more than four dependents, check the box under De- pendents on page 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR and include a statement showing the information required in columns (1) through (4). The dependents you claim are those you list by name and SSN in the Dependents section on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Before you begin. See the definition of Social security num- ber, later. If you want to claim the child tax credit or the credit for other dependents, you (and your spouse if filing jointly) must have an SSN or ITIN issued on or before the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions). If an ITIN is applied for on or before the due date of a 2024 return (including exten- sions) and the IRS issues an ITIN as a result of the application, the IRS will consider the ITIN as issued on or before the due date of the return. TIP Do You Have a Qualifying Child? A qualifying child is your... Son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, half brother, half sister, or a descendant of any of them (for example, your grandchild, niece, or nephew) AND was ...

An adopted child is always treated as your own child. An adopted child includes a child lawfully placed with you for legal adoption. Adoption taxpayer identification numbers (ATINs). If you have a dependent who was placed with you for legal adoption and you don’t know the dependent’s SSN, you must get an ATIN for the dependent from the IRS. See Form W-7A for de- tails. If the dependent isn't a U.S. citizen or resident alien, apply for an ITIN instead using Form W-7. Children of divorced or separated parents. A child will be treated as the qualifying child or qualifying relative of the child’s noncustodial parent (defined later) if all of the following conditions apply. 1. The parents are divorced, legally separated, separated un- der a written separation agreement, or lived apart at all times during the last 6 months of 2024 (whether or not they are or were married). 2. The child received over half of the child’s support for 2024 from the parents (and the rules on Multiple support agree- ments, later, don’t apply). Support of a child received from a pa- rent's spouse is treated as provided by the parent. 3. The child is in custody of one or both of the parents for more than half of 2024. 4. Either of the following applies. a. The custodial parent signs Form 8332 or a substantially similar statement that they won't claim the child as a dependent for 2024, and the noncustodial parent includes a copy of the form or statement with their return. If the divorce decree or sep- aration agreement went into effect after 1984 and before 2009, the noncustodial parent may be able to include certain pages from the decree or agreement instead of Form 8332. See Post-1984 and pre-2009 decree or agreement and Post-2008 de- cree or agreement. b. A pre-1985 decree of divorce or separate maintenance or written separation agreement between the parents provides that the noncustodial parent can claim the child as a dependent, and the noncustodial parent provides at least $600 for support of the child during 2024. If conditions (1) through (4) apply, only the noncustodial pa- rent can claim the child for purposes of the child tax credits and credit for other dependents (lines 19 and 28). However, this doesn't allow the noncustodial parent to claim head of house- hold filing status, the credit for child and dependent care expen- ses, the exclusion for dependent care benefits, or the earned in- come credit. The custodial parent or another taxpayer, if eligi- ble, can claim the child for the earned income credit and these other benefits. See Pub. 501 for details. Custodial and noncustodial parents. The custodial parent is the parent with whom the child lived for the greater number of nights in 2024. The noncustodial parent is the other parent. If the child was with each parent for an equal number of nights, the custodial parent is the parent with the higher adjusted gross income. See Pub. 501 for an exception for a parent who works at night, rules for a child who is emancipated under state law, and other details. Post-1984 and pre-2009 decree or agreement. The decree or agreement must state all three of the following. 1. The noncustodial parent can claim the child as a depend- ent without regard to any condition, such as payment of support. 2. The other parent won't claim the child as a dependent. 3. The years for which the claim is released. The noncustodial parent must include all of the following pa- ges from the decree or agreement. • Cover page (include the other parent's SSN on that page). • The pages that include all the information identified in (1) through (3) above. • Signature page with the other parent's signature and date of agreement. You must include the required information even if you filed it with your return in an earlier year. Post-2008 decree or agreement. If the divorce decree or separation agreement went into effect after 2008, the noncusto- dial parent can't include pages from the decree or agreement in- stead of Form 8332. The custodial parent must sign either Form 8332 or a substantially similar statement the only purpose of which is to release the custodial parent's claim to certain tax benefits for a child, and the noncustodial parent must include a copy with their return. The form or statement must release the custodial parent's claim to the child without any conditions. For example, the release must not depend on the noncustodial pa- rent paying support. Release of certain tax benefits revoked. A custodial parent who has revoked their previous release of a claim to certain tax benefits for a child must include a copy of the revocation with their return. For details, see Form 8332. Exception to citizen test. If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. na- tional and your adopted child lived with you all year as a mem- ber of your household, that child meets the requirement to be a U.S. citizen in Step 2, question 1; Step 3, question 2; Step 4, question 2; and Step 5, question 2. Exception to gross income test. If your relative (including a person who lived with you all year as a member of your house- hold) is permanently and totally disabled (defined later), certain income for services performed at a sheltered workshop may be excluded for this test. For details, see Pub. 501. Exception to time lived with you. Temporary absences by you or the other person for special circumstances, such as school, vacation, business, medical care, military service, or detention in a juvenile facility, count as time the person lived with you. Also see Children of divorced or separated parents, earlier, or Kidnapped child, later. If the person meets all other requirements to be your qualify- ing child but was born or died in 2024, the person is considered to have lived with you for more than half of 2024 if your home was this person's home for more than half the time the person was alive in 2024. If the person meets all other requirements to be your qualifying child but you adopted the person in 2024, the CAUTION ! 20 Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. person was lawfully placed with you for legal adoption by you in 2024, or the person was an eligible foster child placed with you during 2024, the person is considered to have lived with you for more than half of 2024 if your main home was this per- son's main home for more than half the time since the person was adopted or placed with you in 2024. Any other person is considered to have lived with you for all of 2024 if the person was born or died in 2024 and your home was this person's home for the entire time the person was alive in 2024 or if you adopted the person in 2024, the person was lawfully placed with you for legal adoption by you in 2024, or the person was an eligible foster child placed with you during 2024 and your main home was the person's main home for the entire time since the person was adopted or placed with you in 2024. Foster child. A foster child is any child placed with you by an authorized placement agency or by judgment, decree, or other order of any court of competent jurisdiction. Kidnapped child. If your child is presumed by law enforce- ment authorities to have been kidnapped by someone who isn't a family member, you may be able to take the child into account in determining your eligibility for head of household or qualify- ing surviving spouse filing status, the child tax credit, the credit for other dependents, and the earned income credit (EIC). For details, see Pub. 501 (Pub. 596 for the EIC). Married person. If the person is married and files a joint re- turn, you can't claim that person as your dependent. However, if the person is married but doesn't file a joint return or files a joint return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or es- timated tax paid, you may be able to claim that person as a de- pendent. (See Pub. 501 for details and examples.) In that case, go to Step 2, question 3 (for a qualifying child), or Step 4, ques- tion 4 (for a qualifying relative). Multiple support agreements. If no one person contributed over half of the support of your relative (or a person who lived with you all year as a member of your household) but you and another person(s) provided more than half of your relative's support, special rules may apply that would treat you as having provided over half of the support. For details, see Pub. 501. Permanently and totally disabled. A person is permanently and totally disabled if, at any time in 2024, the person can't en- gage in any substantial gainful activity because of a physical or mental condition and a doctor has determined that this condition has lasted or can be expected to last continuously for at least a year or can be expected to lead to death. Public assistance payments. If you received payments under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program or other public assistance program and you used the money to support another person, see Pub. 501. Qualifying child of more than one person. Even if a child meets the conditions to be the qualifying child of more than one person, only one person can claim the child as a qualifying child for all of the following tax benefits, unless the special rule for Children of divorced or separated parents, described earlier, ap- plies. 1. Child tax credit and credit for other dependents (line 19) and additional child tax credit (line 28). 2. Head of household filing status. 3. Credit for child and dependent care expenses (Schedule 3, line 2). 4. Exclusion for dependent care benefits (Form 2441, Part III). 5. Earned income credit (line 27). No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed based on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can claim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. For purposes of these rules, the term \"parent\" means a biologi- cal or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a step- parent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the indi- vidual. • If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parent. • If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parents. • If the parents don’t file a joint return together but both pa- rents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child lived for the longer period of time in 2024. If the child lived with each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the high- er adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2024. • If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2024. • If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no parent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualify- ing child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2024, but only if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any parent of the child who can claim the child. Example. Your child meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. Your child doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, includ- ing your child’s other parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim your child as a qualifying child for all of the five tax benefits just listed for which you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of those five tax benefits based on your child. However, if your parent’s AGI is higher than yours and you do not claim your child as a qualifying child, your child is the qual- ifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 501. If you will be claiming the child as a qualifying child, go to Step 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't claim any benefits based on this child. Social security number. You must enter each dependent's so- cial security number (SSN). Be sure the name and SSN entered agree with the dependent's social security card. Otherwise, at the time we process your return, we may reduce or disallow any tax benefits (such as the child tax credit) based on that depend- ent. If the name or SSN on the dependent's social security card isn't correct or you need to get an SSN for your dependent, con- tact the Social Security Administration (SSA). See Social Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. 21 Security Number (SSN), earlier. If your dependent won't have a number by the date your return is due, see What if You Can't File on Time? earlier. For the child tax credit, your child must have the required SSN. The required SSN is one that is valid for employment and that is issued by the SSA before the due date of your 2024 re- turn (including extensions). If your child was a U.S. citizen when the child received the SSN, the SSN is valid for employ- ment. If “Not Valid for Employment” is printed on your child’s social security card and your child’s immigration status has changed so that your child is now a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, ask the SSA for a new social security card without the legend. However, if “Valid for Work Only With DHS Authori- zation” is printed on your child’s social security card, your child has the required SSN only as long as the DHS authorization is valid. If your dependent child was born and died in 2024 and you do not have an SSN for the child, enter “Died” in column (2) of the Dependents section and include a copy of the child's birth certificate, death certificate, or hospital records. The document must show the child was born alive. If you, or your spouse if filing jointly, didn't have an SSN (or ITIN) issued on or before the due date of your 2024 return (in- cluding extensions), you can't claim the child tax credit or the credit for other dependents on your original or an amended 2024 return. If you apply for an ITIN on or before the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions) and the IRS issues you an ITIN as a result of the application, the IRS will consider your ITIN as issued on or before the due date of your return. Student. A student is a child who during any part of 5 calendar months of 2024 was enrolled as a full-time student at a school or took a full-time, on-farm training course given by a school or a state, county, or local government agency. A school includes a technical, trade, or mechanical school. It doesn't include an on-the-job training course, correspondence school, or school of- fering courses only through the Internet. 22 Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. Income Generally, you must report all income except income that is exempt from tax by law. For details, see the following in- structions and the Schedule 1 instruc- tions, especially the instructions for lines 1 through 7 and Schedule 1, lines 1 through 8z. Also see Pub. 525. Forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loans You don’t need to include the amount of a forgiven PPP Loan in your income. Although you don’t need to report the income from the forgiveness of your PPP Loan on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, you do need to report certain informa- tion related to your PPP Loan as an at- tachment to your tax return. For more information, see Pub. 525. Foreign-Source Income You must report unearned income, such as interest, dividends, and pensions, from sources outside the United States unless exempt by law or a tax treaty. You must also report earned income, such as wages and tips, from sources outside the United States. If you worked abroad, you may be able to exclude part or all of your for- eign earned income. For details, see Pub. 54 and Form 2555. Foreign retirement plans. If you were a beneficiary of a foreign retirement plan, you may have to report the undis- tributed income earned in your plan. However, if you were the beneficiary of a Canadian registered retirement plan, see Rev. Proc. 2014-55, 2014-44 I.R.B. 753, available at IRS.gov/irb/ 2014-44_IRB#RP-2014-55, to find out if you can elect to defer tax on the undis- tributed income. Report distributions from foreign pension plans on lines 5a and 5b. Foreign accounts and trusts. You must complete Part III of Schedule B if you: • Had a foreign account; or • Received a distribution from, or were a grantor of, or a transferor to, a foreign trust. You may also have to file Form 3520. Foreign financial assets. If you had foreign financial assets in 2024, you may have to file Form 8938. See Form 8938 and its instructions. Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Cases If you are a debtor in a chapter 11 bank- ruptcy case, income taxable to the bank- ruptcy estate and reported on the estate's income tax return includes: • Earnings from services you per- formed after the beginning of the case (both wages and self-employment in- come); and • Income from property described in section 541 of title 11 of the U.S. Code that you either owned when the case be- gan or that you acquired after the case began and before the case was closed, dismissed, or converted to a case under a different chapter. Because this income is taxable to the estate, don’t include this income on your own individual income tax return. The only exception is for purposes of figur- ing your self-employment tax. For that purpose, you must take into account all your self-employment income for the year from services performed both be- fore and after the beginning of the case. Also, you (or the trustee if one is ap- pointed) must allocate between you and the bankruptcy estate the wages, salary, or other compensation and withheld in- come tax reported to you on Form W-2. A similar allocation is required for in- come and withheld income tax reported to you on Forms 1099. You must also in- clude a statement that indicates you filed a chapter 11 case and that explains how income and withheld income tax repor- ted to you on Forms W-2 and 1099 are allocated between you and the estate. For more details, including acceptable allocation methods, see Notice 2006-83, 2006-40 I.R.B. 596, available at IRS.gov/irb/ 2006-40_IRB#NOT-2006-83. Community Property States Community property states include Ari- zona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Ne- vada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. If you and your spouse lived in a community property state, you must usually follow state law to deter- mine what is community income and what is separate income. For details, see Form 8958 and Pub. 555. Nevada, Washington, and California domestic partners. A registered do- mestic partner in Nevada, Washington, or California must generally report half the combined community income of the individual and their domestic partner. See Form 8958 and Pub. 555. Rounding Off to Whole Dollars You can round off cents to whole dollars on your return and schedules. If you do round to whole dollars, you must round all amounts. To round, drop amounts un- der 50 cents and increase amounts from 50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For ex- ample, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50 be- comes $3. If you have to add two or more amounts to figure the amount to enter on a line, include cents when adding the amounts and round off only the total. If you are entering amounts that in- clude cents, make sure to include the decimal point. There is no cents column on the form. The lines on Forms 1040 and 1040-SR are the same. Referen- ces to lines in the following in- structions refer to the line on either form. Line 1a Total Amount From Form(s) W-2, Box 1 Enter the total amount from Form(s) W-2, box 1. If a joint return, also in- clude your spouse's income from Form(s) W-2, box 1. If you earned wages while you were an inmate in a penal insti- tution, report these amounts on Schedule 1, line 8u. Do not report these wages on line 1a. See the instructions for Schedule 1, line 8u. If you received a pension or an- nuity from a nonqualified defer- red compensation plan or a nongovernmental section 457(b) plan and it was reported in box 1 of Form W-2, do not include this amount on Form 1040, line 1a.

If you and your spouse both received nontaxable Medic- aid waiver payments during the year, CAUTION ! you and your spouse can make different choices about including payments in earned income. See the instructions for Schedule 1, line 8s. If you are a sole proprietor in a business of providing home care services, see the Schedule C instructions for how to report these amounts. Your nontaxable Medicaid waiver payments may have been reported to you on Form(s) W-2, box 12, with Code II. If you received nontaxable Medicaid waiver payments, and box 1 of your Form(s) W-2 is blank or has zeros, and you are choos- ing not to include nontaxable payments in earned income for purposes of claim- ing a credit, do not attach any of these Form(s) W-2 to your return.

Line 1g Wages From Form 8919, Line 6 Enter the total of your wages from Form 8919, line 6. Line 1h Other Earned Income If you received scholarship or fellowship grants that were not reported to you on Form W-2, report these amounts on Schedule 1, line 8r. See the instructions for Schedule 1, line 8r. The following types of income must be included in the total on line 1h. • Strike or lockout benefits (other than bona fide gifts). • Excess elective deferrals. The amount deferred should be shown in box 12 of your Form W-2, and the “Re- tirement plan” box in box 13 should be checked. If the total amount you (or your spouse if filing jointly) deferred for 2024 under all plans was more than $23,000 (excluding catch-up contribu- tions, as explained later), include the ex- cess on line 1h. This limit is (a) general- ly, $16,000 if you have only SIMPLE plans, or (b) $26,000 for section 403(b) plans if you qualify for the 15-year rule in Pub. 571. Although designated Roth contributions are subject to this limit, don’t include the excess attributable to such contributions on line 1h. They are already included as income in box 1 of your Form W-2. A higher limit of $17,600 may apply to participants in certain SIMPLE plans. A higher limit may also apply to partici- pants in section 457(b) deferred com- pensation plans for the 3 years before re- tirement age. Contact your plan adminis- trator for more information. If you were age 50 or older at the end of 2024, your employer may have al- lowed an additional deferral (catch-up contributions) of up to $7,500 (general- ly, $3,500 for section 401(k)(11) and SIMPLE plans). This additional deferral amount isn't subject to the overall limit on elective deferrals. A higher catch-up contribution limit of $3,850 may apply to participants in TIP 24 Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. certain SIMPLE plans. Contact your plan administrator for more information. You can't deduct the amount de- ferred. It isn't included as in- come in box 1 of your Form W-2. • Disability pensions shown on Form 1099-R if you haven’t reached the minimum retirement age set by your employer. But see Insurance Premiums for Retired Public Safety Officers in the instructions for lines 5a and 5b. Disability pensions received after you reach minimum retirement age and other payments shown on Form 1099-R (other than payments from an IRA) are reported on lines 5a and 5b. Payments from an IRA are reported on lines 4a and 4b. • Corrective distributions from a retirement plan shown on Form 1099-R of excess elective deferrals and excess contributions (plus earnings).

Were You a Statutory Employee? If you were a statutory employee, the “Statutory employee” box in box 13 of your Form W-2 should be checked. Stat- utory employees include full-time life insurance salespeople and certain agent or commission drivers, certain traveling salespeople, and certain homeworkers. Statutory employees report the amount shown in box 1 of Form W-2 on a Schedule C along with any related busi- ness expenses. Missing or Incorrect Form W-2? Your employer is required to provide or send Form W-2 to you no later than January 31, 2025. If you don’t receive it by early February, use Tax Topic 154 to CAUTION ! find out what to do. Even if you don’t get a Form W-2, you must still report your earnings. If you lose your Form W-2 or it is incorrect, ask your employer for a new one. Line 2a Tax-Exempt Interest If you received any tax-exempt interest (including any tax-exempt original issue discount (OID)), such as from municipal bonds, each payer should send you a Form 1099-INT or a Form 1099-OID. In general, your tax-exempt stated interest should be shown in box 8 of Form 1099-INT or, for a tax-exempt OID bond, in box 2 of Form 1099-OID, and your tax-exempt OID should be shown in box 11 of Form 1099-OID. Enter the total on line 2a. However, if you ac- quired a tax-exempt bond at a premium, only report the net amount of tax-ex- empt interest on line 2a (that is, the ex- cess of the tax-exempt interest received during the year over the amortized bond premium for the year). Also, if you ac- quired a tax-exempt OID bond at an ac- quisition premium, only report the net amount of tax-exempt OID on line 2a (that is, the excess of tax-exempt OID for the year over the amortized acquisi- tion premium for the year). See Pub. 550 for more information about OID, bond premium, and acquisition premium. Also include on line 2a any ex- empt-interest dividends from a mutual fund or other regulated investment com- pany. This amount should be shown in box 12 of Form 1099-DIV. Don’t include interest earned on your IRA, health savings account, Archer or Medicare Advantage MSA, or Coverdell education savings account. Don’t include any amounts re- lated to the forgiveness of PPP Loans on this line. Line 2b Taxable Interest Each payer should send you a Form 1099-INT or Form 1099-OID. Enter your total taxable interest income on line 2b. But you must fill in and attach Schedule B if the total is over $1,500 or any of the other conditions listed at the CAUTION ! beginning of the Schedule B instructions applies to you. For more details about reporting taxa- ble interest, including market discount on bonds and adjustments for amortiza- ble bond premium or acquisition premi- um, see Pub. 550. Interest credited in 2024 on deposits that you couldn't withdraw because of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the fi- nancial institution may not have to be included in your 2024 income. For de- tails, see Pub. 550. If you get a 2024 Form 1099-INT for U.S. savings bond interest that includes amounts you reported before 2024, see Pub. 550. Line 3a Qualified Dividends Enter your total qualified dividends on line 3a. Qualified dividends are also in- cluded in the ordinary dividend total re- quired to be shown on line 3b. Qualified dividends are eligible for a lower tax rate than other ordinary income. Gener- ally, these dividends are shown in box 1b of Form(s) 1099-DIV. See Pub. 550 for the definition of qualified divi- dends if you received dividends not re- ported on Form 1099-DIV. Exception. Some dividends may be re- ported as qualified dividends in box 1b of Form 1099-DIV but aren't qualified dividends. These include: • Dividends you received as a nomi- nee. See the Schedule B instructions. • Dividends you received on any share of stock that you held for less than 61 days during the 121-day period that began 60 days before the ex-dividend date. The ex-dividend date is the first date following the declaration of a divi- dend on which the purchaser of a stock isn't entitled to receive the next dividend payment. When counting the number of days you held the stock, include the day you disposed of the stock but not the day you acquired it. See the examples that follow. Also, when counting the number of days you held the stock, you can't count certain days during which your risk of loss was diminished. See Pub. 550 for more details. • Dividends attributable to periods totaling more than 366 days that you re- ceived on any share of preferred stock TIP Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. 25 held for less than 91 days during the 181-day period that began 90 days be- fore the ex-dividend date. When count- ing the number of days you held the stock, you can't count certain days dur- ing which your risk of loss was dimin- ished. See Pub. 550 for more details. Preferred dividends attributable to peri- ods totaling less than 367 days are sub- ject to the 61-day holding period rule just described. • Dividends on any share of stock to the extent that you are under an obliga- tion (including a short sale) to make re- lated payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related proper- ty. • Payments in lieu of dividends, but only if you know or have reason to know that the payments aren't qualified dividends. • Dividends from a corporation that first became a surrogate foreign corpora- tion after December 22, 2017, other than a foreign corporation that is treated as a domestic corporation under section 7874(b). Example 1. You bought 5,000 shares of XYZ Corp. common stock on July 8. XYZ Corp. paid a cash dividend of 10 cents per share. The ex-dividend date was July 16. Your Form 1099-DIV from XYZ Corp. shows $500 in box 1a (ordi- nary dividends) and in box 1b (qualified dividends). However, you sold the 5,000 shares on August 11. You held your shares of XYZ Corp. for only 34 days of the 121-day period (from July 9 through August 11). The 121-day period began on May 17 (60 days before the ex-divi- dend date) and ended on September 14. You have no qualified dividends from XYZ Corp. because you held the XYZ stock for less than 61 days. Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that you bought the stock on July 15 (the day before the ex-dividend date), and you sold the stock on September 16. You held the stock for 63 days (from July 16 through September 16). The $500 of qualified dividends shown in box 1b of Form 1099-DIV are all qualified dividends be- cause you held the stock for 61 days of the 121-day period (from July 16 through September 14). Example 3. You bought 10,000 shares of ABC Mutual Fund common stock on July 8. ABC Mutual Fund paid a cash dividend of 10 cents a share. The ex-dividend date was July 16. The ABC Mutual Fund advises you that the part of the dividend eligible to be treated as qualified dividends equals 2 cents a share. Your Form 1099-DIV from ABC Mutual Fund shows total ordinary divi- dends of $1,000 and qualified dividends of $200. However, you sold the 10,000 shares on August 11. You have no quali- fied dividends from ABC Mutual Fund because you held the ABC Mutual Fund stock for less than 61 days. Use the Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Work- sheet or the Schedule D Tax Worksheet, whichever applies, to figure your tax. See the instructions for line 16 for details. Line 3b Ordinary Dividends Each payer should send you a Form 1099-DIV. Enter your total ordinary div- idends on line 3b. This amount should be shown in box 1a of Form(s) 1099-DIV. You must fill in and attach Sched- ule B if the total is over $1,500 or you received, as a nominee, ordinary divi- dends that actually belong to someone else. Nondividend Distributions Some distributions are a return of your cost (or other basis). They won't be taxed until you recover your cost (or other basis). You must reduce your cost (or other basis) by these distributions. After you get back all of your cost (or other basis), you must report these dis- tributions as capital gains on Form 8949. For details, see Pub. 550. Dividends on insurance policies are a partial return of the pre- miums you paid. Don’t report them as dividends. Include them in in- come on Schedule 1, line 8z, only if they exceed the total of all net premiums you paid for the contract. Lines 4a and 4b IRA Distributions You should receive a Form 1099-R showing the total amount of any distri- TIP TIP bution from your IRA before income tax or other deductions were withheld. This amount should be shown in box 1 of Form 1099-R. Unless otherwise noted in the line 4a and 4b instructions, an IRA includes a traditional IRA (which in- cludes a traditional IRA that receives contributions from a simplified employ- ee pension (SEP) arrangement), Roth IRA (which includes a Roth IRA that re- ceives contributions from a SEP ar- rangement), and a SIMPLE IRA (a SIM- PLE IRA may either be a traditional SIMPLE IRA or a Roth SIMPLE IRA). Attach Form(s) 1099-R to Form 1040 or 1040-SR if any federal income tax was withheld. For purposes of these Excep- tions, Roth IRA includes a Roth SIMPLE IRA. Exception 1. Enter the total distribution on line 4a if you rolled over part or all of the distribution from one: • Roth IRA to another Roth IRA, or • IRA (other than a Roth IRA) to a qualified plan or another IRA (other than a Roth IRA). Also enter “Rollover” next to line 4b. If the total distribution was rolled over, enter -0- on line 4b. If the total distribu- tion wasn't rolled over, enter the part not rolled over on line 4b unless Exception 2 applies to the part not rolled over. Gen- erally, a rollover must be made within 60 days after the day you received the distribution. For more details on roll- overs, see Pub. 590-A and Pub. 590-B. If you rolled over the distribution into a qualified plan or you made the rollover in 2025, include a statement explaining what you did. Exception 2. If any of the following ap- ply, enter the total distribution on line 4a and see Form 8606 and its instructions to figure the amount to enter on line 4b. 1. You received a distribution from an IRA (other than a Roth IRA) and you made nondeductible contributions to any of your traditional IRAs for 2024 or an earlier year. If you made nondeductible contributions to these IRAs for 2024, al- so see Pub. 590-A and Pub. 590-B. 2. You received a distribution from a Roth IRA. But if either (a) or (b) be- low applies, enter -0- on line 4b; you don’t have to see Form 8606 or its in- structions. TIP TIP 26 Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. a. Distribution code T is shown in box 7 of Form 1099-R and you made a contribution (including a conversion) to a Roth IRA for 2018 or an earlier year. b. Distribution code Q is shown in box 7 of Form 1099-R. 3. You converted part or all of a tra- ditional IRA or traditional SIMPLE IRA to a Roth IRA in 2024. 4. You had a 2023 or 2024 IRA con- tribution returned to you, with the rela- ted earnings or less any loss, by the due date (including extensions) of your tax return for that year. 5. You made excess contributions to your IRA for an earlier year and had them returned to you in 2024. 6. You recharacterized part or all of a contribution to a Roth IRA as a contri- bution to a traditional IRA, or vice ver- sa. Exception 3. If all or part of the distri- bution is a qualified charitable distribu- tion (QCD), enter the total distribution on line 4a. If the total amount distributed is a QCD, enter -0- on line 4b. If only part of the distribution is a QCD, enter the part that is not a QCD on line 4b un- less Exception 2 applies to that part. En- ter “QCD” next to line 4b. A QCD is a distribution made direct- ly by the trustee of your IRA (other than an ongoing SEP or SIMPLE IRA) to an organization eligible to receive tax-de- ductible contributions (with certain ex- ceptions). You must have been at least age 70 1/2 when the distribution was made. Generally, your total QCDs for the year can't be more than $105,000. This includes any amount (up to $53,000) of a one-time QCD to a split-interest entity (SIE). If you file a joint return, the same rules apply to your spouse. The amount of the QCD is limited to the amount that would otherwise be included in your in- come. If your IRA includes nondeducti- ble contributions, the distribution is first considered to be paid out of otherwise taxable income. If you make the one-time QCD to an SIE, you must at- tach a statement to your return. See Pub. 590-B for details on QCDs, including the information you must include on the attachment for QCDs to an SIE. You can't claim a charitable contribution deduction for any QCD not included in your in- come. Exception 4. If all or part of the distri- bution is a health savings account (HSA) funding distribution (HFD), enter the to- tal distribution on line 4a. If the total amount distributed is an HFD and you elect to exclude it from income, enter -0- on line 4b. If only part of the distribu- tion is an HFD and you elect to exclude that part from income, enter the part that isn't an HFD on line 4b unless Exception 2 applies to that part. Enter “HFD” next to line 4b. An HFD is a distribution made di- rectly by the trustee of your IRA (other than an ongoing SEP or SIMPLE IRA) to your HSA. If eligible, you can gener- ally elect to exclude an HFD from your income once in your lifetime. You can't exclude more than the limit on HSA contributions or more than the amount that would otherwise be included in your income. If your IRA includes nondeduc- tible contributions, the HFD is first con- sidered to be paid out of otherwise taxa- ble income. See Pub. 969 for details. The amount of an HFD reduces the amount you can contribute to your HSA for the year. If you fail to maintain eligibility for an HSA for the 12 months following the month of the HFD, you may have to report the HFD as income and pay an additional tax. See Form 8889, Part III. More than one exception applies. If more than one exception applies, include a statement showing the amount of each exception, instead of making an entry next to line 4b. For example: “Line 4b – $1,000 Rollover and $500 HFD.” But you don’t need to attach a statement if only Exception 2 and one other excep- tion apply. More than one distribution. If you (or your spouse if filing jointly) received more than one distribution, figure the taxable amount of each distribution and enter the total of the taxable amounts on line 4b. Enter the total amount of those distributions on line 4a. CAUTION ! CAUTION ! You must start receiving at least a minimum amount from your traditional IRA by April 1 of the year following the year you reach age 73. If you don’t receive the minimum dis- tribution amount, you may have to pay an additional tax on the amount that should have been distributed. For de- tails, including how to figure the mini- mum required distribution, see Pub. 590-B. You may have to pay an addi- tional tax if you received an early distribution from your IRA and the total wasn't rolled over. See the instructions for Schedule 2, line 8, for details. More information. For more informa- tion about IRAs, see Pub. 590-A and Pub. 590-B. Lines 5a and 5b Pensions and Annuities You should receive a Form 1099-R showing the total amount of your pen- sion and annuity payments before in- come tax or other deductions were with- held. This amount should be shown in box 1 of Form 1099-R. Pension and an- nuity payments include distributions from 401(k), 403(b), and governmental 457(b) plans. Rollovers and lump-sum distributions are explained later. Don’t include the following payments on lines 5a and 5b. Instead, report them on line 1h. • Disability pensions received before you reach the minimum retirement age set by your employer. • Corrective distributions (including any earnings) of excess elective defer- rals or other excess contributions to re- tirement plans. The plan must advise you of the year(s) the distributions are includible in income. Attach Form(s) 1099-R to Form 1040 or 1040-SR if any federal income tax was withheld. Fully Taxable Pensions and Annuities Your payments are fully taxable if (a) you didn't contribute to the cost (see Cost, later) of your pension or annuity, or (b) you got your entire cost back tax free before 2024. But see Insurance Pre- TIP CAUTION ! TIP Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. 27 miums for Retired Public Safety Offi- cers, later. If your pension or annuity is fully taxable, enter the total pension or annuity payments (from Form(s) 1099-R, box 1) on line 5b; don’t make an entry on line 5a. Fully taxable pensions and annuities also include military retirement pay shown on Form 1099-R. For details on military disability pensions, see Pub. 525. If you received a Form RRB-1099-R, see Pub. 575 to find out how to report your benefits. Partially Taxable Pensions and Annuities Enter the total pension or annuity pay- ments (from Form 1099-R, box 1) on line 5a. If your Form 1099-R doesn't show the taxable amount, you must use the General Rule explained in Pub. 939 to figure the taxable part to enter on line 5b. But if your annuity starting date (defined later) was after July 1, 1986, see Simplified Method, later, to find out if you must use that method to figure the taxable part. You can ask the IRS to figure the tax- able part for you for a $1,000 fee. For details, see Pub. 939. If your Form 1099-R shows a taxable amount, you can report that amount on line 5b. But you may be able to report a lower taxable amount by using the Gen- eral Rule or the Simplified Method or if the exclusion for retired public safety of- ficers, discussed next, applies. Insurance Premiums for Retired Public Safety Officers If you are an eligible retired public safe- ty officer (law enforcement officer, fire- fighter, chaplain, or member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew who is retired because of disability or because you reached normal retirement age), you can elect to exclude from income distribu- tions made from your eligible retirement plan that are used to pay the premiums for coverage by an accident or health plan or a long-term care insurance con- tract. The premiums can be for coverage for you, your spouse, or dependents. The distribution must be from the plan main- tained by the employer from which you retired as a public safety officer. The distribution can be made directly from the plan to the provider of the accident or health plan or long-term care insur- ance contract, or the distribution can be made to you to pay to the provider of the accident or health plan or long-term care insurance contract. You can exclude from income the smaller of the amount of the premiums paid or $3,000. You can make this election only for amounts that would otherwise be included in your in- come. The amount excluded from your income can’t be used to claim a medical expense deduction. An eligible retirement plan is a gov- ernmental plan that is a qualified trust or a section 403(a), 403(b), or 457(b) plan. You can exclude from income only the smaller of the amount of the premiums paid or $3,000. This is true if the distribution was made directly from the plan to the provider of the accident or health plan or long-term care insurance contract or if the distri- bution was made to you and you paid the provider of the accident or health plan or long-term care insurance con- tract. If you received a distribution from your eligible retirement plan, and you used part of that distribution to pay pre- miums for an accident or health plan or long-term care insurance contract, you can still exclude from income only the smaller of the amount of the premiums paid or $3,000. The rest of the distribu- tion is taxable to you and must be repor- ted on line 5b. If you make this election, reduce the otherwise taxable amount of your pen- sion or annuity by the amount excluded. The amount shown in box 2a of Form 1099-R doesn't reflect the exclusion. Re- port your total distributions on line 5a and the taxable amount on line 5b. Enter “PSO” next to line 5b. If you are retired on disability and re- porting your disability pension on line 1h, include only the taxable amount on that line and enter “PSO” and the amount excluded on the dotted line next to line 1h. Payments when you are disabled. If you receive payments from a retirement or profit-sharing plan that does not pro- vide for disability retirement, do not treat those payments as disability pay- ments. The payments must be reported as a pension or annuity. You must include in your income any amounts that you received that you CAUTION ! would have received in retirement had you not become disabled as a result of a terrorist attack. Include in your income any payments you receive from a 401(k), pension, or other retirement plan to the extent that you would have re- ceived the amount at the same or later time regardless of whether you had be- come disabled. Example. You were a contractor who was disabled as a direct result of participating in efforts to clean up the World Trade Center and you are eligible for compensation by the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund. You began receiving a disability pension at age 55 when you could no longer work due to your disability. Under your pension plan you are entitled to an early retirement benefit of $2,500 a month at age 55. If you wait until age 62, the normal retire- ment age under the plan, you would be entitled to a normal retirement benefit of $3,000 a month. The pension plan pro- vides that a participant who retires early on account of disability is entitled to re- ceive the participant's normal retirement benefit, which in your case equals $3,000 a month. Until you turn age 62, you can exclude $500 of your monthly retirement benefit from income (the dif- ference between the early retirement benefit and the normal retirement bene- fit, $3,000 - $2,500) received on account of disability. You must report the re- maining $2,500 of monthly pension ben- efit as taxable. For each month after you turn age 62, you must report the full amount of the monthly pension benefit ($3,000 a month) as taxable. Simplified Method You must use the Simplified Method if either of the following applies. 1. Your annuity starting date was af- ter July 1, 1986, and you used this meth- od last year to figure the taxable part. 2. Your annuity starting date was af- ter November 18, 1996, and both of the following apply. a. The payments are from a quali- fied employee plan, a qualified employ- ee annuity, or a tax-sheltered annuity. b. On your annuity starting date, ei- ther you were under age 75 or the num- ber of years of guaranteed payments was fewer than 5. See Pub. 575 for the defi- nition of guaranteed payments. 28 Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov.

For more details on the Simplified Method, see Pub. 575 (or Pub. 721 for U.S. Civil Service retirement benefits). If you received U.S. Civil Serv- ice retirement benefits and you chose the alternative annuity option, see Pub. 721 to figure the taxa- ble part of your annuity. Do not use the Simplified Method Worksheet in these instructions. Annuity Starting Date Your annuity starting date is the later of the first day of the first period for which you received a payment or the date the plan's obligations became fixed. Age (or Combined Ages) at Annuity Starting Date If you are the retiree, use your age on the annuity starting date. If you are the survivor of a retiree, use the retiree's age on their annuity starting date. But if your annuity starting date was after 1997 and the payments are for your life and that of your beneficiary, use your combined ages on the annuity starting date. If you are the beneficiary of an em- ployee who died, see Pub. 575. If there is more than one beneficiary, see Pub. 575 or Pub. 721 to figure each benefi- ciary's taxable amount. Cost Your cost is generally your net invest- ment in the plan as of the annuity start- ing date. It doesn't include pre-tax con- tributions. Your net investment may be shown in box 9b of Form 1099-R. Rollovers Generally, a rollover is a tax-free distri- bution of cash or other assets from one retirement plan that is contributed to an- other plan within 60 days of receiving the distribution. However, a rollover to a Roth IRA or a designated Roth account is generally not a tax-free distribution. Use lines 5a and 5b to report a rollover, including a direct rollover, from one qualified employer's plan to another or to an IRA. CAUTION ! Enter on line 5a the distribution from Form 1099-R, box 1. From this amount, subtract any contributions (usually shown in box 5) that were taxable to you when made. From that result, subtract the amount of the rollover. Enter the re- maining amount on line 5b. If the re- maining amount is zero and you have no other distribution to report on line 5b, enter -0- on line 5b. Also enter \"Roll- over\" next to line 5b. See Pub. 575 for more details on roll- overs, including special rules that apply to rollovers from designated Roth ac- counts, partial rollovers of property, and distributions under qualified domestic relations orders. Lump-Sum Distributions If you received a lump-sum distribution from a profit-sharing or retirement plan, your Form 1099-R should have the \"To- tal distribution\" box in box 2b checked. You may owe an additional tax if you re- ceived an early distribution from a quali- fied retirement plan and the total amount wasn't rolled over. For details, see the instructions for Schedule 2, line 8. Enter the total distribution on line 5a and the taxable part on line 5b. For de- tails, see Pub. 575. If you or the plan participant was born before January 2, 1936, you could pay less tax on the distribution. See Form 4972. Lines 6a, 6b, and 6c Lines 6a and 6b Social Security Benefits You should receive a Form SSA-1099 showing in box 3 the total social securi- ty benefits paid to you. Box 4 will show the amount of any benefits you repaid in 2024. If you received railroad retirement benefits treated as social security, you should receive a Form RRB-1099. Use the Social Security Benefits Worksheet in these instructions to see if any of your benefits are taxable. Exception. Do not use the Social Se- curity Benefits Worksheet in these in- structions if any of the following ap- plies. • You made contributions to a tradi- tional IRA for 2024 and you or your spouse were covered by a retirement TIP plan at work or through self-employ- ment. Instead, use the worksheets in Pub. 590-A to see if any of your social security benefits are taxable and to fig- ure your IRA deduction. • You repaid any benefits in 2024 and your total repayments (box 4) were more than your total benefits for 2024 (box 3). None of your benefits are taxa- ble for 2024. Also, if your total repay- ments in 2024 exceed your total benefits received in 2024 by more than $3,000, you may be able to take an itemized de- duction or a credit for part of the excess repayments if they were for benefits you included in income in an earlier year. For more details, see Pub. 915. • You file Form 2555, 4563, or 8815, or you exclude employer-provided adoption benefits or income from sour- ces within Puerto Rico. Instead, use the worksheet in Pub. 915. Social security information. Social security beneficiaries can now get a variety of infor- mation from the SSA website with a my Social Security account, including get- ting a replacement Form SSA‐1099 if needed. For more information and to set up an account, go to SSA.gov/ myaccount. Disability payments. Don’t include in your income any disability payments (including Social Security Disability In- surance (SSDI) payments) you receive for injuries incurred as a direct result of a terrorist attack directed against the United States (or its allies), whether out- side or within the United States. In the case of the September 11 attacks, inju- ries eligible for coverage by the Septem- ber 11 Victim Compensation Fund are treated as incurred as a direct result of the attack. If these payments are incor- rectly reported as taxable on Form SSA-1099, don't include the nontaxable portion of income on your tax return. You may receive a notice from the IRS regarding the omitted payments. Follow the instructions in the notice to explain that the excluded payments aren't taxa- ble. For more information about these payments, see Pub. 3920. Example. You were a firefighter who was disabled as a direct result of the September 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.

Your birthday is April 25. In the year you turned age 66, you received $1,500 per month in bene- fits from the SSA (for a total of $18,000 for the year). Because you became eligi- ble for a full retirement benefit in May, the month after you turned age 66, you can exclude only 4 months (January through April) of your annual benefit from income ($6,000). You must report the remaining $12,000 on line 6a. You must also complete the Social Security Benefits Worksheet to find out if any part of the $12,000 is taxable. Form RRB-1099. If you need a replacement Form RRB-1099, call the Railroad Retirement Board at 877-772-5772 or go to www.rrb.gov. Accrued leave payment. If you retire on disability, any lump-sum payment you receive for accrued annual leave is a salary payment. The payment is not a disability payment. Include it in your in- come in the tax year you receive it. Line 6c Check the box on line 6c if you elect to use the lump-sum election method for your benefits. If any of your benefits are taxable for 2024 and they include a lump-sum benefit payment that was for an earlier year, you may be able to re- duce the taxable amount with the lump-sum election. See Lump-Sum Elec- tion in Pub. 915 for details. Line 7 Capital Gain or (Loss) If you sold a capital asset, such as a stock or bond, you must complete and attach Form 8949 and Schedule D. Exception 1. You don’t have to file Form 8949 or Schedule D if you aren’t deferring any capital gain by investing in a qualified opportunity fund and both of the following apply. 1. You have no capital losses, and your only capital gains are capital gain distributions from Form(s) 1099-DIV, box 2a (or substitute statements); and 2. None of the Form(s) 1099-DIV (or substitute statements) have an amount in box 2b (unrecaptured section 1250 gain), box 2c (section 1202 gain), or box 2d (collectibles (28%) gain). TIP Exception 2. You must file Schedule D but generally don’t have to file Form 8949 if Exception 1 doesn't apply, you aren’t deferring any capital gain by in- vesting in a qualified opportunity fund or terminating deferral from an invest- ment in a qualified opportunity fund, and your only capital gains and losses are: • Capital gain distributions; • A capital loss carryover from 2023; • A gain from Form 2439 or 6252 or Part I of Form 4797; • A gain or loss from Form 4684, 6781, or 8824; • A gain or loss from a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust; or • Gains and losses from transactions for which you received a Form 1099-B (or substitute statement) that shows ba- sis was reported to the IRS, the QOF box in box 3 isn’t checked, and you don’t need to make any adjustments in column (g) of Form 8949 or enter any codes in column (f) of Form 8949. If Exception 1 applies, enter your to- tal capital gain distributions (from box 2a of Form(s) 1099-DIV) on line 7 and check the box on that line. If you re- ceived capital gain distributions as a nominee (that is, they were paid to you but actually belong to someone else), re- port on line 7 only the amount that be- longs to you. Include a statement show- ing the full amount you received and the amount you received as a nominee. See the Schedule B instructions for filing re- quirements for Forms 1099-DIV and 1096. If you don’t have to file Sched- ule D, use the Qualified Divi- dends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet in the line 16 instructions to figure your tax. Total Income and Adjusted Gross Income Line 10 Enter any adjustments to income from Schedule 1, line 26, on line 10. TIP Tax and Credits Line 12 Itemized Deductions or Standard Deduction In most cases, your federal income tax will be less if you take the larger of your itemized deductions or standard deduc- tion. Itemized Deductions To figure your itemized deductions, fill in Schedule A. If you made a section 962 elec- tion and are taking a deduction under section 250 with respect to any income inclusions under section 951A, don't report the deduction on line 12. Instead, report the tax with re- spect to a section 962 election on line 16 and include in the statement required by line 16 how you figured the section 250 deduction. Standard Deduction Most Form 1040 filers can find their standard deduction by looking at the amounts listed to the left of line 12. Most Form 1040-SR filers can find their standard deduction by using the chart on the last page of Form 1040-SR. Exception 1—Dependent. If you checked the “Someone can claim you as a dependent” box, or if you’re filing jointly and you checked the “Someone can claim your spouse as a dependent” box, use the Standard Deduction Work- sheet for Dependents to figure your standard deduction. Someone claims you or your spouse as a dependent if they list your or your spouse's name and SSN in the Dependents section of their return. Exception 2—Born before January 2, 1960, or blind. If you checked any of the following boxes, figure your stand- ard deduction using the Standard Deduc- tion Chart for People Who Were Born Before January 2, 1960, or Were Blind if you are filing Form 1040 or by using the chart on the last page of Form 1040-SR.

Form 8862, who must file. You must file Form 8862 to claim the child tax credit or credit for other dependents if your child tax credit (refundable or non- refundable depending on the tax year), additional child tax credit, or credit for other dependents for a year after 2015 was denied or reduced for any reason other than a math or clerical error. At- tach a completed Form 8862 to your 2024 return to claim the credit for 2024. Don’t file Form 8862 if you filed Form 8862 for 2023, and the child tax credit, additional child tax credit, or credit for other dependents was allowed for that year. See Form 8862 and its instructions for details. If you claim the child tax credit or credit for other dependents even though you aren't eligible and it is determined that your error is due to reckless or intentional disregard of the rules for these credits, you won't be allowed to take either credit or the additional child tax credit for 2 years even if you're otherwise eligible to do so. If you claim the child tax credit or credit for other dependents even though you aren’t eligible and it is later determined that you fraudulently claimed either credit, you won't be allowed to take ei- ther credit or the additional child tax credit for 10 years. You may also have to pay penalties. If your qualifying child didn’t have an SSN valid for employ- ment issued before the due date of your 2024 return (including exten- sions), you can’t claim the child tax credit for that child on your original or amended return. However, you may be able to claim the credit for other de- pendents for that child. CAUTION ! CAUTION !

The credit may give you a refund even if you don’t owe any tax or didn’t have any tax withheld. To Take the EIC: • Follow the steps below. • Complete the worksheet that applies to you or let the IRS figure the credit for you. • If you have at least one child who meets the conditions to be your qualifying child for purposes of claiming the EIC, com- plete and attach Schedule EIC, even if that child doesn't have a valid SSN. See Schedule EIC for more information, including how to complete Schedule EIC if your qualifying child doesn't have a valid SSN. For help in determining if you are eligible for the EIC, go to IRS.gov/EITC and click on “Check if You Qualify.” This service is available in English and Spanish. If you claim the EIC even though you aren't eligible and it is determined that your error is due to reckless or intentional disregard of the EIC rules, you won't be allowed to take the credit for 2 years even if you are otherwise eligible to do so. If you fraudulently claim the EIC, you won't be allowed to take the credit for 10 years. See Form 8862, who must file, later. You may also have to pay penalties. Refunds for returns claiming the earned income credit can't be issued before mid-February 2025. This delay applies to the entire refund, not just the portion associ- ated with the earned income credit. All Filers 1.

If your EIC for a year after 1996 was reduced or disallowed, see Form 8862, who must file, later. Exception to time lived with you. Temporary absences by you or the child for special circumstances, such as school, vacation, business, medical care, military service, or detention in a juve- nile facility, count as time the child lived with you. Also see Kidnapped child under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, earli- er, and Members of the military, later. A child is considered to have lived with you for more than half of 2024 if the child was born or died in 2024 and your home was this child's home for more than half the time the child was alive in 2024 or if you adopted the child in 2024, the child was lawfully placed with you for legal adoption by you in 2024, or the child was an eligi- ble foster child placed with you during 2024 and your main home was the child's main home for more than half the time since the child was adopted or placed with you in 2024. Form 4797 filers. If the amount on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 7, includes an amount from Form 4797, you must use Worksheet 1 in Pub. 596 to see if you can take the EIC. Other- wise, stop; you can't take the EIC. Form 8862, who must file. You must file Form 8862 if your EIC for a year after 1996 was reduced or disallowed for any reason other than a math or clerical error. But don’t file Form 8862 if either of the following applies. CAUTION ! • You filed Form 8862 for another year, the EIC was al- lowed for that year, and your EIC hasn't been reduced or disal- lowed again for any reason other than a math or clerical error. • You are taking the EIC without a qualifying child and the only reason your EIC was reduced or disallowed in the other year was because it was determined that a child listed on Sched- ule EIC wasn't your qualifying child. Also, don’t file Form 8862 or take the credit for the: • 2 years after the most recent tax year for which there was a final determination that your EIC claim was due to reckless or intentional disregard of the EIC rules, or • 10 years after the most recent tax year for which there was a final determination that your EIC claim was due to fraud. Foster child. A foster child is any child placed with you by an authorized placement agency or by judgment, decree, or other order of any court of competent jurisdiction. For more details on authorized placement agencies, see Pub. 596. Main home. Your main home may be your house, apartment, mobile home, shelter, temporary lodging, or other location and doesn't need to be the same physical location throughout 2024. You don't need a permanent address. Married child. A child who was married at the end of 2024 is a qualifying child only if (a) you can claim the child as your de- pendent, or (b) you could have claimed the child as your de- pendent except for the special rule for Children of divorced or separated parents under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, ear- lier. Members of the military. If you were on extended active duty outside the United States, your main home is considered to be in the United States during that duty period. Extended active duty is military duty ordered for an indefinite period or for a period of more than 90 days. Once you begin serving extended active duty, you are considered to be on extended active duty even if you don’t serve more than 90 days. Nonresident aliens. If you checked the box in the Filing Status section to treat a nonresident alien or dual-status alien spouse as a U.S. resident for the entire year, go to Step 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't take the EIC. Enter “No” on the dotted line next to line 27. See Nonresident aliens and dual-status aliens, earlier. Permanently and totally disabled. A person is permanently and totally disabled if, at any time in 2024, the person couldn't engage in any substantial gainful activity because of a physical or mental condition and a doctor has determined that this condi- tion (a) has lasted or can be expected to last continuously for at least a year, or (b) can be expected to lead to death. Qualifying child of more than one person. Even if a child meets the conditions to be the qualifying child of more than one person, only one person can claim the child as a qualifying child for all of the following tax benefits, unless the special rule for Children of divorced or separated parents under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, earlier, applies. 1. Child tax credit, credit for other dependents, and addi- tional child tax credit (lines 19 and 28). 2. Head of household filing status. 3. Credit for child and dependent care expenses (Schedule 3, line 2). Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. 41 4. Exclusion for dependent care benefits (Form 2441, Part III). 5. Earned income credit (line 27). No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed based on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can claim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. For purposes of these rules, the term “parent” means a biologi- cal or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a step- parent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the indi- vidual. • If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parent. • If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parents. • If the parents don’t file a joint return together but both pa- rents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child lived for the longer period of time in 2024. If the child lived with each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the high- er adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2024. • If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2024. • If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no parent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualify- ing child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2024, but only if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any parent of the child who can claim the child. If, under these rules, you can't claim a child as a quali- fying child for the EIC, you may be able to claim the EIC under the rules for a taxpayer without a qualifying child. For more information, see Pub. 596. Example. Your child, Lee, meets the conditions to be a qual- ifying child for both you and your parent. Lee doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, includ- ing Lee’s other parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim Lee as a qualifying child for all of the five tax benefits lis- ted here for which you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of the five tax benefits listed here based on Lee. However, if your parent’s AGI is higher than yours and you don’t claim Lee as a qualifying child, Lee is the qualifying child of your parent. TIP For more details and examples, see Pub. 596. Social security number (SSN). For the EIC, a valid SSN is a number issued by the Social Security Administration unless “Not Valid for Employment” is printed on the social security card and the number was issued solely to allow the recipient of the SSN to apply for or receive a federally funded benefit. If “Not Valid for Employment” is printed on the social security card and the cardholder’s immigration status has changed so that they are now a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, ask the SSA for a new social security card without the legend. Howev- er, if “Valid for Work Only With DHS Authorization” is printed on your social security card, your SSN is valid for EIC purposes only as long as the DHS authorization is still valid. To find out how to get an SSN, see Social Security Number (SSN) near the beginning of these instructions. If you won't have an SSN by the date your return is due, see What if You Can't File on Time? If you didn't have an SSN issued on or before the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions), you can't claim the EIC on your original or an amended 2024 return. If a child didn't have an SSN issued on or before the due date of your return (in- cluding extensions), you can't count that child as a qualifying child in figuring the amount of the EIC on your original or an amended 2024 return. Student. A student is a child who during any part of 5 calendar months of 2024 was enrolled as a full-time student at a school or took a full-time, on-farm training course given by a school or a state, county, or local government agency. A school includes a technical, trade, or mechanical school. It doesn't include an on-the-job training course, correspondence school, or school of- fering courses only through the Internet. Welfare benefits, effect of credit on. Any refund you receive as a result of taking the EIC can't be counted as income when determining if you or anyone else is eligible for benefits or as- sistance, or how much you or anyone else can receive, under any federal program or under any state or local program fi- nanced in whole or in part with federal funds. These programs include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Supple- mental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps). In addition, when determining eligibility, the refund can't be coun- ted as a resource for at least 12 months after you receive it. Check with your local benefit coordinator to find out if your re- fund will affect your benefits. 42 Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. A Worksheet —2024 EIC—Line 27 1040 1040-SR or Yes.

Line 28 Additional Child Tax Credit See Schedule 8812 (Form 1040) and its instructions for information on figuring and claiming any additional child tax credit that you may qualify to claim. If you are claiming the additional child tax credit, complete Schedule 8812 and at- tach it to your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Form 8862, who must file. You must file Form 8862 to claim the additional child tax credit if your child tax credit (refundable or nonrefundable depending on the tax year), additional child tax credit, or credit for other dependents for a year after 2015 was denied or reduced for any reason other than a math or cleri- cal error. Attach a completed Form 8862 to your 2024 return to claim the credit for 2024. Don't file Form 8862 if you filed Form 8862 for 2023 and the child tax credit, additional child tax credit, or credit for other dependents was allowed for that year. See Form 8862 and its in- structions for details. If you claim the additional child tax credit even though you aren't eligible and it is deter- mined that your error is due to reckless or intentional disregard of the additional child tax credit rules, you won't be al- lowed to take the child tax credit, the credit for other dependents, or the addi- tional child tax credit for 2 years even if you’re otherwise eligible to do so. If you claim the additional child tax credit even though you aren’t eligible and it is later determined that you fraudulently claimed the credit, you won't be allowed to take the child tax credit, the credit for other dependents, or the additional child tax credit for 10 years. You may also have to pay penalties. Refunds for returns claiming the additional child tax credit can't be issued before mid-Feb- ruary 2025. This delay applies to the en- tire refund, not just the portion associ- ated with the additional child tax credit. CAUTION ! TIP Line 29 American Opportunity Credit If you meet the requirements to claim an education credit (see the instructions for Schedule 3, line 3), enter on line 29 the amount, if any, from Form 8863, line 8. You may be able to increase an educa- tion credit and reduce your total tax or increase your tax refund if the student chooses to include all or part of a Pell grant or certain other scholarships or fel- lowships in income. See Pub. 970 and the Instructions for Form 8863 for more information. Form 8862 required. You must file Form 8862 to claim the American op- portunity credit if your American oppor- tunity credit for a year after 2015 was denied or reduced for any reason other than a math or clerical error. Attach a completed Form 8862 to your 2024 re- turn to claim the credit for 2024. Don't file Form 8862 if you filed Form 8862 for 2023 and the American opportunity credit was allowed for that year. See Form 8862 and its instructions for de- tails. If you claim the American op- portunity credit even though you aren't eligible and it is de- termined that your error is due to reck- less or intentional disregard of the American opportunity credit rules, you won't be allowed to take the credit for 2 years even if you’re otherwise eligible to do so. If you claim the American oppor- tunity credit even though you aren't eli- gible and it is determined that you frau- dulently claimed the credit, you won't be allowed to take the credit for 10 years. You may also have to pay penalties. Line 30 Line 30 has been reserved for future use. Refund Line 34 Amount Overpaid If line 34 is under $1, we will send a re- fund only on written request. CAUTION ! Refund Offset If you owe past-due federal tax, state in- come tax, state unemployment compen- sation debts, child support, spousal sup- port, or certain federal nontax debts, such as student loans, all or part of the overpayment on line 34 may be used (offset) to pay the past-due amount. Off- sets for federal taxes are made by the IRS. All other offsets are made by the Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service. For federal tax offsets, you will receive a notice from the IRS. For all other offsets, you will receive a notice from the Fiscal Service. To find out if you may have an offset or if you have any questions about it, contact the agency to which you owe the debt. Deposit Refund Into Multiple Accounts If you want your refund to be split and direct deposited into more than one ac- count, file Form 8888. Use Form 8888 to direct deposit your refund (or part of it) to one or more accounts in your name at a bank or other financial institution (such as a mutual fund, brokerage firm, or credit union) in the United States. Injured Spouse If you file a joint return and your spouse hasn’t paid past-due federal tax, state in- come tax, state unemployment compen- sation debts, child support, spousal sup- port, or a federal nontax debt, such as a student loan, part or all of the overpay- ment on line 34 may be used (offset) to pay the past-due amount. But your part of the overpayment may be refunded to you if certain conditions apply and you complete Form 8379. For details, see Form 8379. Lines 35a Through 35d Amount Refunded to You If you want to check the status of your refund, just use the IRS2Go app or go to IRS.gov/Refunds. See Refund Informa- tion, later. Information about your re- fund will generally be available within 24 hours after the IRS receives your e-filed return, or 4 weeks after you mail your paper return. If you filed Form 8379 with your return, wait 14 weeks (11 weeks if you filed electronically). Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. 57 Have your 2024 tax return handy so you can enter your social security number, your filing status, and the exact whole dollar amount of your refund. Where's My Refund will provide a personalized refund date as soon as the IRS processes your tax return and appro- ves your refund. Claiming a refund for a deceased tax- payer. If you are filing a joint return with your deceased spouse, you only need to file the tax return to claim the refund. If you are a court-appointed rep- resentative, file the return and include a copy of the certificate that shows your appointment. All other filers requesting the deceased taxpayer's refund must file the return and attach Form 1310. Effect of refund on benefits. Any re- fund you receive can't be counted as in- come when determining if you or any- one else is eligible for benefits or assistance, or how much you or anyone else can receive, under any federal pro- gram or under any state or local program financed in whole or in part with federal funds. These programs include Tempo- rary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, Supplemental Secur- ity Income (SSI), and Supplemental Nu- trition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps). In addition, when deter- mining eligibility, the refund can't be counted as a resource for at least 12 months after you receive it. Check with your local benefit coordinator to find out if your refund will affect your benefits. Simple. Safe. Secure. DIRECT DEPOSIT Fast Refunds! Join the eight in 10 taxpayers who choose direct deposit—a fast, simple, safe, secure way to have your refund deposited automatically to your checking or savings account, including an individual retirement arrangement (IRA). See the information about IRAs, later. If you want us to directly deposit the amount shown on line 35a to your checking, savings, health savings, bro- kerage or other similar account, includ- ing an IRA, at a bank or other financial institution (such as a mutual fund, bro- kerage firm, or credit union) in the Uni- ted States: • Complete lines 35b through 35d (if you want your refund deposited to only one account), or • Check the box on line 35a and at- tach Form 8888 if you want to split the direct deposit of your refund into more than one account. If you don’t want your refund directly deposited to your account, don’t check the box on line 35a. Draw a line through the boxes on lines 35b and 35d. We will send you a check instead. Account must be in your name. Don’t request a deposit of your refund to an account that isn't in your name, such as your tax return preparer’s account. Al- though you may owe your tax return preparer a fee for preparing your return, don’t have any part of your refund de- posited into the preparer's account to pay the fee. The number of refunds that can be di- rectly deposited to a single account or prepaid debit card is limited to three a year. After this limit is reached, paper checks will be sent instead. Learn more at IRS.gov/DepositLimit. Why Use Direct Deposit? • You get your refund faster by di- rect deposit than you do by check. • Payment is more secure. There is no check that can get lost or stolen. • It is more convenient. You don’t have to make a trip to the bank to depos- it your check. • It saves tax dollars. It costs the government less to refund by direct de- posit. • It's proven itself. Nearly 98% of social security and veterans' benefits are sent electronically using direct deposit. If you file a joint return and check the box on line 35a and attach Form 8888 or fill in lines 35b through 35d, your spouse may get at least part of the refund. IRA. You can have your refund (or part of it) directly deposited to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, but not a SIMPLE IRA. You must establish the IRA at a bank or other financial institution before you request direct deposit. Make sure your direct deposit will be accepted. You must also notify the trustee or custodian of your account of the year to which the deposit is to be applied (unless the trust- ee or custodian won't accept a deposit for 2024). If you don’t, the trustee or custodian can assume the deposit is for the year during which you are filing the CAUTION ! return. For example, if you file your 2024 return during 2025 and don’t noti- fy the trustee or custodian in advance, the trustee or custodian can assume the deposit to your IRA is for 2025. If you designate your deposit to be for 2024, you must verify that the deposit was ac- tually made to the account by the due date of the return (not counting exten- sions). If the deposit isn't made by that date, the deposit isn't an IRA contribu- tion for 2024. In that case, you must file an amended 2024 return and reduce any IRA deduction and any retirement sav- ings contributions credit you claimed. You and your spouse, if filing jointly, each may be able to contribute up to $7,000 ($8,000 if age 50 or older at the end of 2024) to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA for 2024. You may owe an additional tax if your contributions exceed these limits, and the limits may be lower depending on your compensation and income. For more information on IRA contributions, see Pub. 590-A. For more information on IRAs, see Pub. 590-A and Pub. 590-B. Form 8888. You can have your refund directly deposited into more than one ac- count. For more information, see the Form 8888 instructions. Your refund can be split and di- rectly deposited into up to three different accounts in your name on Form 8888. Line 35b The routing number must be nine digits. The first two digits must be 01 through 12 or 21 through 32. On the sample check shown later, the routing number is 250250025. C. and M. Keys would use that routing number unless their finan- cial institution instructed them to use a different routing number for direct de- posits. Ask your financial institution for the correct routing number to enter on line 35b if: • The routing number on a deposit slip is different from the routing number on your checks, • Your deposit is to a savings ac- count that doesn't allow you to write checks, or CAUTION ! TIP 58 Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. • Your checks state they are payable through a financial institution different from the one at which you have your checking account. Line 35c Check the appropriate box for the type of account. Don’t check more than one box. If the deposit is to an account such as an IRA, health savings account, bro- kerage account, or other similar account, ask your financial institution whether you should check the “Checking” or “Savings” box. You must check the cor- rect box to ensure your deposit is accep- ted. Line 35d The account number can be up to 17 characters (both numbers and letters). Include hyphens but omit spaces and special symbols. Enter the number from left to right and leave any unused boxes blank. On the sample check shown later, the account number is 20202086. Don’t include the check number. If the direct deposit to your ac- count(s) is different from the amount you expected, you will receive an ex- planation in the mail about 2 weeks after your refund is deposited. Reasons Your Direct Deposit Request Will Be Rejected If any of the following apply, your direct deposit request will be rejected and a check will be sent instead. • You are asking to have a joint re- fund deposited to an individual account, and your financial institution(s) won't al- low this. The IRS isn't responsible if a financial institution rejects a direct de- posit. • The name on your account doesn't match the name on the refund, and your financial institution(s) won't allow a re- fund to be deposited unless the name on the refund matches the name on the ac- count. • Three direct deposits of tax re- funds already have been made to the same account or prepaid debit card. • You haven't given a valid account number. • Any numbers or letters on lines 35b through 35d are crossed out or whi- ted out. The IRS isn't responsible for a lost refund if you enter the wrong account information. Check with your financial institution to get the correct routing and account numbers and to make sure your direct deposit will be accepted. Line 36 Applied to Your 2025 Estimated Tax Enter on line 36 the amount, if any, of the overpayment on line 34 you want applied to your 2025 estimated tax. We will apply this amount to your account unless you include a statement request- ing us to apply it to your spouse's ac- count. Include your spouse's social se- curity number in the statement. This election to apply part or all of the amount overpaid to your 2025 estimated tax can't be changed later. CAUTION ! CAUTION ! Amount You Owe To avoid interest and penalties, pay your taxes in full by the due date of your return (not includ- ing extensions)—April 15, 2025, for most taxpayers. You don’t have to pay if line 37 is under $1. Include any estimated tax penalty from line 38 in the amount you enter on line 37. Don’t include any estimated payments for 2025 in this payment. In- stead, make the estimated payment sepa- rately. Bad check or payment. The penalty for writing a bad check to the IRS is $25 or 2% of the check, whichever is more. However, if the amount of the check is less than $25, the penalty equals the amount of the check. This also applies to other forms of payment if the IRS doesn’t receive the funds. Use Tax Topic 206. Line 37 Amount You Owe The IRS offers several payment options. You can pay online, by phone, mobile device, cash, check, or money order. Go to IRS.gov/Payments for payment op- tions.

To find out about the different cash payment methods, go to IRS.gov/PayCash. Don’t send cash payments through the mail. Pay by Check or Money Order Before submitting a payment through the mail, please consider alternative methods. One of our safe, quick, and easy electronic payment options might be right for you. If you choose to mail a tax payment, make your check or money order payable to “United States Treas- ury” for the full amount due. Don’t send cash. Don’t attach the payment to your return. Write “2024 Form 1040” or “2024 Form 1040-SR” and your name, address, daytime phone number, and so- cial security number (SSN) on your pay- ment and attach Form 1040-V. For the most up-to-date information on Form 1040-V, go to IRS.gov/Form1040V. If you are filing a joint return, enter the SSN shown first on your tax return. To help us process your payment, en- ter the amount on the right side of the check like this: $ XXX.XX. Don’t use dashes or lines (for example, don’t enter “$ XXX–” or “$ XXXxx/100”). Mail your 2024 tax return, payment, and Form 1040-V to the address shown on the form that applies to you. If you e-filed your return, but choose to make a payment through the mail, mail your 2024 payment and Form 1040-V to the address shown on the form that applies to you. Notice to taxpayers presenting checks. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use in- formation from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment, and you won’t receive your check back from your financial institution. No checks of $100 million or more accepted. The IRS can’t accept a single check (including a cashier’s check) for amounts of $100,000,000 ($100 million) or more. If you are sending $100 million or more by check, you’ll need to spread the payment over 2 or more checks with each check made out for an amount less than $100 million. This limit doesn’t ap- ply to other methods of payment (such as electronic payments). Please consider a method of payment other than check if the amount of the payment is over $100 million. What if You Can't Pay? If you can't pay the full amount shown on line 37 when you file, you can ask for: • An installment agreement, or • An extension of time to pay. Installment agreement. Under an in- stallment agreement, you can pay all or part of the tax you owe in monthly in- stallments. However, even if an install- ment agreement is granted, you will be charged interest and may be charged a late payment penalty on the tax not paid by the due date of your return (not counting extensions)—April 15, 2025, for most people. You must also pay a fee. To limit the interest and penalty charges, pay as much of the tax as possi- ble when you file. But before requesting an installment agreement, you should consider other less costly alternatives, such as a bank loan or credit card pay- ment. 60 Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. To ask for an installment agreement, you can apply online or use Form 9465. To apply online, go to IRS.gov/OPA. Extension of time to pay. If paying the tax when it is due would cause you an undue hardship, you can ask for an ex- tension of time to pay by filing Form 1127 by the due date of your return (not counting extensions)—April 15, 2025, for most people. An extension generally won't be granted for more than 6 months. You will be charged interest on the tax not paid by April 15, 2025. You must pay the tax before the extension runs out. If you do not pay the tax by the extended due date, penalties and interest will be imposed until taxes are paid in full. For the most up-to-date information on Form 1127, go to IRS.gov/Form1127. Line 38 Estimated Tax Penalty You may owe this penalty if: • Line 37 is at least $1,000 and it is more than 10% of the tax shown on your return, or • You didn't pay enough estimated tax by any of the due dates. This is true even if you are due a refund. For most people, the “tax shown on your return” is the amount on your 2024 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 24, minus the total of any amounts shown on lines 27, 28, and 29; Schedule 3, lines 9 and 12; and Forms 8828, 4137, 5329 (Parts III through IX only), and 8919. Also subtract from line 24 any: • Tax on an excess parachute pay- ment, • Excise tax on insider stock com- pensation of an expatriated corporation, • Uncollected social security and Medicare or RRTA tax on tips or group-term life insurance, • Look-back interest due under sec- tion 167(g) or 460(b). When figuring the amount on line 24, include household employment taxes only if line 25d is more than zero or you would owe the penalty even if you didn't include those taxes. Exception. You won't owe the penalty if your 2023 tax return was for a tax year of 12 full months and either of the following applies. 1. You had no tax shown on your 2023 return and you were a U.S. citizen or resident for all of 2023. 2. The total of lines 25d, 26, and Schedule 3, line 11, on your 2024 return is at least 100% of the tax shown on your 2023 return (110% of that amount if you aren't in the business of farming or fishing, and your adjusted gross in- come (AGI) shown on your 2023 return was more than $150,000 (more than $75,000 if married filing separately for 2024)). Your estimated tax payments for 2024 must have been made on time and for the required amount. For most people, the “tax shown on your 2023 return” is the amount on your 2023 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 24, minus the total of any amounts shown on lines 27, 28, and 29; Schedule 3, lines 9 and 12; Schedule H, lines 8e and 8f; and Forms 8828, 4137, 5329 (Parts III through IX only), and 8919. Also subtract from line 24 any: • Tax on an excess parachute pay- ment, • Excise tax on insider stock com- pensation of an expatriated corporation, • Uncollected social security and Medicare or RRTA tax on tips or group-term life insurance, and • Look-back interest due under sec- tion 167(g) or 460(b). When figuring the amount on line 24, include household employment taxes only if line 25d is more than zero or you would have owed the estimated tax pen- alty for 2023 even if you didn't include those taxes. If the Exception just described doesn't apply, see the Instructions for Form 2210 for other situations in which you may be able to lower your penalty by filing Form 2210. Figuring the Penalty If you choose to figure the penalty your- self, use Form 2210 (or 2210-F for farm- ers and fishers). Enter any penalty on line 38. Add the penalty to any tax due and enter the total on line 37. However, if you have an overpay- ment on line 34, subtract the penalty from the amount you would otherwise enter on line 35a or line 36. Lines 35a, 36, and 38 must equal line 34. If the penalty is more than the over- payment on line 34, enter -0- on lines 35a and 36. Then, subtract line 34 from line 38 and enter the result on line 37. Don’t file Form 2210 with your re- turn unless Form 2210 indicates that you must do so. Instead, keep it for your re- cords. Because Form 2210 is compli- cated, you can leave line 38 blank and the IRS will figure the penalty and send you a bill. We won't charge you interest on the penalty if you pay by the date specified on the bill. There are situations where the IRS can't figure your penalty for you and you must file Form 2210. See Form 2210 for de- tails. Third Party Designee If you want to allow your preparer, a friend, a family member, or any other person you choose to discuss your 2024 tax return with the IRS, check the “Yes” box in the “Third Party Designee” area of your return. Also enter the designee's name, phone number, and any five digits the designee chooses as their personal identification number (PIN). If you check the “Yes” box, you, and your spouse if filing a joint return, are authorizing the IRS to call the designee to answer any questions that may arise during the processing of your return. You are also authorizing the designee to: • Give the IRS any information that is missing from your return; • Call the IRS for information about the processing of your return or the sta- tus of your refund or payment(s); • Receive copies of notices or tran- scripts related to your return, upon re- quest; and • Respond to certain IRS notices about math errors, offsets, and return preparation. You aren't authorizing the designee to receive any refund check, bind you to anything (including any additional tax liability), or otherwise represent you be- fore the IRS. If you want to expand the designee's authorization, see Pub. 947. This authorization will automatically end no later than the due date (not counting extensions) for filing your 2025 tax return. This is April 15, 2026, for most people. TIP Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. 61 Sign Your Return Form 1040 or 1040-SR isn't considered a valid return unless you sign it in ac- cordance with the requirements in these instructions. If you are filing a joint re- turn, your spouse must also sign. If your spouse can't sign the return, see Pub. 501. Be sure to date your return and en- ter your occupation(s). If you have someone prepare your return, you are still responsible for the correctness of the return. If your return is signed by a representative for you, you must have a power of attorney attached that specifi- cally authorizes the representative to sign your return. To do this, you can use Form 2848. If you are filing a joint re- turn with your spouse who died in 2024, see Death of a Taxpayer, earlier. Court-Appointed Conservator, Guardian, or Other Fiduciary If you are a court-appointed conservator, guardian, or other fiduciary for a men- tally or physically incompetent individu- al who has to file Form 1040 or 1040-SR, sign your name for the indi- vidual and file Form 56. Child's Return If your child can't sign their return, ei- ther parent can sign the child's name in the space provided. Then, enter “By (your signature), parent for minor child.” Requirements for a Paper Return You must handwrite your signature on your return if you file it on paper. Digi- tal, electronic, or typed-font signatures are not valid signatures for Forms 1040 or 1040-SR filed on paper. Requirements for an Electronic Return The requirements for signing an elec- tronic return will be different depending on whether you use tax software or a tax practitioner. If you are filing electroni- cally using Direct File, you should fol- low the instructions provided to you by Direct File for how to sign your elec- tronic return. Otherwise, to file your re- turn electronically, you must sign the re- turn electronically using a personal iden- tification number (PIN) and provide the information described below. If you are filing online using software, you must use a Self-Select PIN. If you are filing electronically using a tax practitioner, you can use a Self-Select PIN or a Prac- titioner PIN. If we issued you an identity protec- tion personal identification number (IP PIN) (as described in more detail next), all six digits of your IP PIN must appear in the IP PIN spaces provided next to the space for your occupation for your elec- tronic signature to be complete. Failure to include an issued IP PIN on the elec- tronic return will result in an invalid sig- nature and a rejected return. If you are filing a joint return and both taxpayers were issued an IP PIN, enter both IP PINs in the spaces provided. Self-Select PIN. The Self-Select PIN method allows you to create your own PIN. If you are married filing jointly, you and your spouse will each need to create a PIN and enter these PINs as your electronic signatures. A PIN is any combination of five dig- its you choose except five zeros. If you use a PIN, there are no papers to sign and nothing to mail—not even your Form(s) W-2. Your electronic return signed with a Self-Select PIN is considered a validly signed return only when it includes your PIN, last name, date of birth, IP PIN, if applicable, and your adjusted gross in- come (AGI) from your originally filed 2023 federal income tax return, if appli- cable. If you're filing jointly, your elec- tronic return must also include your spouse's PIN, last name, date of birth, IP PIN, if applicable, and AGI, if applica- ble, in order to be considered validly signed. (You, and your spouse if filing jointly, may each use your own pri- or-year PIN to verify your identity if you filed electronically last year. If you use your prior-year PIN or enter your IP PIN, you are not required to enter your prior-year AGI. The prior-year PIN is the five-digit PIN you used to electroni- cally sign your 2023 return.) If you need your AGI from your orig- inally filed 2023 federal income tax re- turn, and you don’t have your 2023 in- come tax return, you can access your transcript through your online account at IRS.gov/Account. You can also go to IRS.gov/Transcript or call the IRS at 800-908-9946 to get a free transcript of your return. Don’t use your AGI from an amended return (Form 1040-X) or a math error correction made by the IRS. AGI is the amount shown on your 2023 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11. For more information, go to IRS.gov/ Efile. You can't use the Self-Select PIN method if you are a first-time filer under age 16 at the end of 2024. Practitioner PIN. The Practitioner PIN method allows you to authorize your tax practitioner to enter or generate your PIN. Your electronic return is considered a validly signed return only when it in- cludes your PIN, last name, date of birth, and IP PIN, if applicable. If you're filing jointly, your electronic return must also include your spouse's PIN, last name, date of birth, and IP PIN, if appli- cable, in order to be considered validly signed. The practitioner can provide you with details. Form 8453. You must send in a paper Form 8453 if you have to attach certain forms or other documents that can't be electronically filed. See Form 8453. Identity Protection PIN All taxpayers are now eligible for an Identity Protection Per- sonal Identification Number (IP PIN). For more information, see Pub. 5477. To apply for an IP PIN, go to IRS.gov/IPPIN and use the Get an IP PIN tool. If you received an IP PIN from the IRS, enter it in the IP PIN spaces provided next to the space for your occupation. You must correctly enter all six numbers of your IP PIN. If you didn't receive an IP PIN, leave these spaces blank. New IP PINs are generated ev- ery year. They will generally be sent out by mid-January 2025. Use this IP PIN on your 2024 return as well as any prior-year returns you file in 2025. If you are filing a joint return and both taxpayers receive an IP PIN, enter both IP PINs in the spaces provided. CAUTION ! TIP CAUTION ! 62 Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. If you need more information, includ- ing how to retrieve your IP PIN online, go to IRS.gov/IPPIN. If you’re unable to retrieve your IP PIN online, you can call 800-908-4490. Phone Number and Email Address You have the option of entering your phone number and email address in the spaces provided. There will be no effect on the processing of your return if you choose not to enter this information. Note that the IRS initiates most contacts through regular mail delivered by the United States Postal Service. For information on how to report phone scams or unsolicited emails claiming to be from the IRS, see Secure Your Tax Records From Identity Theft, later. Paid Preparer Must Sign Your Return Generally, anyone you pay to prepare your return must sign it and include their Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) in the space provided. The pre- parer must give you a copy of the return for your records. Someone who prepares your return but doesn't charge you shouldn’t sign your return. If your paid preparer is self-em- ployed, then they should check the “self-employed” checkbox. Assemble Your Return Assemble any schedules and forms be- hind Form 1040 or 1040-SR in order of the “Attachment Sequence No.” shown in the upper-right corner of the schedule or form. If you have supporting state- ments, arrange them in the same order as the schedules or forms they support and attach them last. File your return, sched- ules, and other attachments on standard size paper. Cutting the paper may cause problems in processing your return. Don’t attach correspondence or other items unless required to do so. Attach Forms W-2 and 2439 to Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If you received a Form W-2c (a corrected Form W-2), attach your original Forms W-2 and any Forms W-2c. Attach Forms W-2G and 1099-R to Form 1040 or 1040-SR if tax was withheld.

How To Avoid Common Mistakes Mistakes can delay your refund or result in notices being sent to you. One of the best ways to file an accurate return is to file electronically. Tax software does the math for you and will help you avoid mistakes. Direct File and Free File pro- vide eligible taxpayers the ability to file their taxes electronically for free. See IRS.gov/DirectFile and IRS.gov/FreeFile for details and to see if you are eligible. • File your return on a standard size sheet of paper. Cutting the paper may cause problems in processing your re- turn. • Make sure you entered the correct name and social security number (SSN) for each dependent you claim in the De- pendents section. Check that each de- pendent's name and SSN agrees with the dependent’s social security card. For each child under age 17 who is a quali- fying child for the child tax credit or each dependent who qualifies you for the credit for other dependents, make sure you checked the appropriate box in column (4) of the Dependents section. • Check your math, especially for the child tax credit, earned income credit (EIC), taxable social security benefits, total income, itemized deductions or standard deduction, taxable income, to- tal tax, federal income tax withheld, and refund or amount you owe. • Be sure you used the correct meth- od to figure your tax. See the instruc- tions for line 16. • Be sure to enter your SSN in the space provided on page 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If you are married filing a joint or separate return, also enter your spouse's SSN. Be sure to enter your SSN in the space next to your name. Check that your name and SSN agree with your social security card. • Make sure your name and address are correct. Enter your (and your spou- se's) name in the same order as shown on your last return. • If you live in an apartment, be sure to include your apartment number in your address. • If you are taking the standard de- duction, see the instructions for line 12 to be sure you entered the correct amount. • If you received capital gain distri- butions but weren't required to file Schedule D, make sure you checked the box on line 7. • If you are taking the EIC, be sure you used the correct column of the EIC Table for your filing status and the num- ber of qualifying children you have who have valid SSNs. • Remember to sign and date Form 1040 or 1040-SR and enter your occupa- tion(s). • Attach your Form(s) W-2 and oth- er required forms and schedules. Put all forms and schedules in the proper order. See Assemble Your Return, earlier. • If you owe tax and are paying by check or money order, be sure to include all the required information on your pay- ment. See the instructions for line 37 for details. • Make sure to check Where Do You File? before mailing your return. Over the next several years, the IRS will be reducing the number of paper tax return processing sites. Because of this, you may need to mail your return to a differ- ent address than you have in the past. • Don’t file more than one original return for the same year, even if you haven't gotten your refund or haven't heard from the IRS since you filed. Fil- ing more than one original return for the same year, or sending in more than one copy of the same return (unless we ask you to do so), could delay your refund. • Make sure that if you, your spouse with whom you are filing a joint return, or your dependent was enrolled in Mar- ketplace coverage, and advance pay- ments of the premium tax credit were made for the coverage, that you attach Form 8962. For tax years other than 2020, you may have to repay excess ad- vance payments, even if someone else enrolled you, your spouse, or your de- pendent in the Marketplace coverage. Excess advance payments may also have to be repaid if you enrolled someone in Marketplace coverage, you don't claim that individual as a dependent, and no one else claims that individual as a de- pendent. See the instructions for Sched- ule 2, line 1a, and the Instructions for Form 8962. You or whoever enrolled you should have received Form 1095-A from the Marketplace with information about who was covered and any advance payments of the premium tax credit. Innocent Spouse Relief Generally, both you and your spouse are each responsible for paying the full amount of tax, interest, and penalties on your joint return. However, you may qualify for relief from liability for tax on a joint return if (a) there is an under- statement of tax because your spouse omitted income or claimed false deduc- tions or credits; (b) you are divorced, separated, or no longer living with your spouse; or (c) given all the facts and cir- cumstances, it wouldn't be fair to hold you liable for the tax. You may also qualify for relief if you were a married resident of a community property state but didn't file a joint return and are now liable for an unpaid or understated tax. File Form 8857 to request relief. In some cases, Form 8857 may need to be filed within 2 years of the date on which the IRS first attempted to collect the tax from you. Don’t file Form 8857 with your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. For more information, see Pub. 971 and Form 8857, or you can call the Innocent Spouse office toll free at 855-851-2009. 77 Income Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax Payments for 2025 You can use the Tax Withholding Estimator instead of Pub. 505 or the worksheets included with Form W-4 or W-4P to de- termine whether you need to have your withholding increased or decreased. In general, you don’t have to make estimated tax payments if you expect that your 2025 Form 1040 or 1040-SR will show a tax refund or a tax balance due of less than $1,000. If your total es- timated tax for 2025 is $1,000 or more, see Form 1040-ES and Pub. 505 for a worksheet you can use to see if you have to make estimated tax payments. For more details, see Pub. 505. Secure Your Tax Records From Identity Theft All taxpayers can now apply for an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN). Go to IRS.gov/ GetAnIPPIN to request an IP PIN through your online account, file Form 15227 if your AGI on your last filed re- turn is less than $79,000 ($158,000 if married filing jointly), or make an ap- pointment to visit a Taxpayer Assistance Center. Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information, such as your name, social security number (SSN), or other identifying information, without your permission to commit fraud or other crimes. An identity thief may use your SSN to get a job or may file a tax return using your SSN to re- ceive a refund. To reduce your risk: • Protect your SSN, • Ensure your employer is protecting your SSN, and • Be careful when choosing a tax re- turn preparer. If your tax records are affected by identity theft and you receive a notice from the IRS, respond right away to the name and phone number printed on the IRS notice or letter. For more informa- tion, see Pub. 5027. TIP TIP If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you are a victim of tax-rela- ted identity theft, visit IRS.gov/ IdentityTheft to learn what steps you should take. Victims of identity theft who are ex- periencing economic harm or a systemic problem, or are seeking help in resolv- ing tax problems that haven't been re- solved through normal channels, may be eligible for Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) assistance. You can reach TAS by calling the National Taxpayer Advocate helpline at 877-777-4778. People who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability and who have access to TTY/TDD equipment can call 800-829-4059. Deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals can also contact the IRS through Telecommunications Relay Services at FCC.gov/TRS. Protect yourself from suspicious emails, texts, and social media mes- sages, phishing schemes, and phone scams. Phishing is the creation and use of emails, texts, social media messages, and websites designed to mimic legiti- mate business communication and web- sites. The most common form is sending an email to a user falsely claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam the user into surrender- ing private information that will be used for identity theft. The IRS doesn't initiate contact with or request detailed personal information from taxpayers via emails, texts, or so- cial media messages. Also, the IRS doesn't ask taxpayers for the PIN num- bers, passwords, or similar secret access information for their credit card, bank, or other financial accounts. If you receive an unsolicited email claiming to be from the IRS, forward the message to phishing@irs.gov. For more information, go to IRS.gov/Phishing. You may also report misuse of the IRS name, logo, forms, or other IRS property to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration toll free at 800-366-4484. People who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disa- bility and who have access to TTY/TDD equipment can call 800-877-8339. You can report suspicious emails, texts, and social media messages to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at ftc.gov/ complaint. You can contact them at www.ftc.gov/idtheft or 877-IDTHEFT (877-438-4338). If you have been the victim of identity theft, see www.IdentityTheft.gov and Pub. 5027. People who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability and who have access to TTY/TDD equipment can call 866-653-4261. Visit IRS.gov and enter “identity theft” in the search box to learn more about identity theft and how to reduce your risk. You can report a phone scam to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Ad- ministration at IRS Impersonation Scam Reporting or the FTC using the FTC Complaint Assistant at FTC.gov. Add “IRS Telephone Scam” in the notes. How Do You Make a Gift To Reduce Debt Held By the Public? If you wish to do so, go to Pay.gov and make a contribution by credit card, debit card, PayPal, checking account, or sav- ings account. If you prefer, you can make a check payable to the “Bureau of the Fiscal Service” and send it to: Bu- reau of the Fiscal Service, Attn: Depart- ment G, P.O. Box 2188, Parkersburg, WV 26106-2188. Or you can enclose the check with your income tax return when you file. In the memo section of the check, make a note that it is a gift to reduce the debt held by the public. Don’t add your gift to any tax you may owe. See the instructions for line 37 for de- tails on how to pay any tax you owe. For information on how to make this type of gift online, go to TreasuryDirect.gov/ Help-Center/Public-Debt-FAQs/ #DebtFinance and click on “How do you make a contribution to reduce the debt?” You may be able to deduct this gift on your 2025 tax return. How Long Should Records Be Kept? Keep a copy of your tax return, work- sheets you used, and records of all items appearing on it (such as Forms W-2 and 1099) until the statute of limitations runs out for that return. Usually, this is 3 years from the date the return was due or filed or 2 years from the date the tax was paid, whichever is later. You should TIP 78 keep some records longer. For example, keep property records (including those on your home) as long as they are nee- ded to figure the basis of the original or replacement property. For more details, see chapter 1 of Pub. 17. Amended Return File Form 1040-X to change a return you already filed. Generally, to timely claim a refund on your amended return, Form 1040-X must be filed within 3 years after the date the original return was filed or within 2 years after the date the tax was paid, whichever is later. But you may have more time to file Form 1040-X if you live in a federally de- clared disaster area or you are physically or mentally unable to manage your fi- nancial affairs. See Pub. 556 for details. You can file Form 1040-X electroni- cally with tax filing software to amend Forms 1040 and 1040-SR. See IRS.gov/ Filing/Amended-Return-Frequently- Asked-Questions for more information. Use the Where's My Amended Return application on IRS.gov to track the sta- tus of your amended return.

There are various types of tax re- turn preparers, including enrolled agents, certified public accountants (CPAs), accountants, and many others who don’t have professional credentials. If you choose to have someone prepare your tax return, choose that preparer wisely. A paid tax preparer is: • Primarily responsible for the over- all substantive accuracy of your return, • Required to sign the return, and • Required to include their preparer tax identification number (PTIN). Although the tax preparer al- ways signs the return, you're ul- timately responsible for provid- ing all the information required for the preparer to accurately prepare your re- turn and for the accuracy of every item reported on the return. Anyone paid to prepare tax returns for others should have a thorough understanding of tax matters. For more information on how to choose a tax preparer, go to Tips for Choosing a Tax Preparer on IRS.gov. Employers can register to use Busi- ness Services Online.

Eight in 10 taxpayers use direct deposit to receive their re- funds. If you don’t have a bank account, go to IRS.gov/DirectDeposit for more information on where to find a bank or credit union that can open an account online. Reporting and resolving your tax-re- lated identity theft issues. • Tax-related identity theft happens when someone steals your personal in- formation to commit tax fraud. Your tax- es can be affected if your SSN is used to file a fraudulent return or to claim a re- fund or credit. • The IRS doesn’t initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text messages (including shortened links), telephone calls, or social media channels to request or verify personal or financial informa- tion. This includes requests for personal identification numbers (PINs), pass- words, or similar information for credit cards, banks, or other financial accounts. • Go to IRS.gov/IdentityTheft, the IRS Identity Theft Central webpage, for information on identity theft and data se- curity protection for taxpayers, tax pro- fessionals, and businesses. If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you’re a victim of tax-related identity theft, you can learn what steps you should take. • Get an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN). IP PINs are six-digit numbers as- signed to taxpayers to help prevent the misuse of their SSNs on fraudulent fed- eral income tax returns. When you have an IP PIN, it prevents someone else from filing a tax return with your SSN. To learn more, go to IRS.gov/IPPIN. Ways to check on the status of your refund. • Go to IRS.gov/Refunds. • Download the official IRS2Go app to your mobile device to check your re- fund status. • Call the automated refund hotline at 800-829-1954. The IRS can’t issue refunds be- fore mid-February for returns that claimed the EIC or the ad- ditional child tax credit (ACTC). This applies to the entire refund, not just the portion associated with these credits. Making a tax payment. Payments of U.S. tax must be remitted to the IRS in U.S. dollars. Digital assets are not ac- cepted. Go to IRS.gov/Payments for in- formation on how to make a payment using any of the following options. • IRS Direct Pay: Pay your individu- al tax bill or estimated tax payment di- rectly from your checking or savings ac- count at no cost to you. • Debit Card, Credit Card, or Digital Wallet: Choose an approved pay- ment processor to pay online or by phone. • Electronic Funds Withdrawal: Schedule a payment when filing your federal taxes using tax return prepara- tion software or through a tax professio- nal. • Electronic Federal Tax Payment System: This is the best option for busi- nesses. Enrollment is required. • Check or Money Order: Mail your payment to the address listed on the no- tice or instructions. • Cash: You may be able to pay your taxes with cash at a participating retail store. • Same-Day Wire: You may be able to do same-day wire from your financial institution. Contact your financial insti- tution for availability, cost, and time frames. Note. The IRS uses the latest encryp- tion technology to ensure that the elec- tronic payments you make online, by phone, or from a mobile device using the IRS2Go app are safe and secure. Paying electronically is quick, easy, and faster than mailing in a check or money order. CAUTION ! What if I can’t pay now? Go to IRS.gov/Payments for more information about your options. • Apply for an online payment agreement (IRS.gov/OPA) to meet your tax obligation in monthly installments if you can’t pay your taxes in full today. Once you complete the online process, you will receive immediate notification of whether your agreement has been ap- proved. • Use the Offer in Compromise Pre- Qualifier to see if you can settle your tax debt for less than the full amount you owe. For more information on the Offer in Compromise program, go to IRS.gov/ OIC. Filing an amended return. Go to IRS.gov/Form1040X for information and updates. Checking the status of your amended return. Go to IRS.gov/WMAR to track the status of Form 1040-X amended re- turns.

You may not immediately receive written communications in the requested lan- guage. The IRS’s commitment to LEP taxpayers is part of a multi-year timeline that began providing translations in 2023. You will continue to receive com- munications, including notices and let- ters, in English until they are translated to your preferred language. Contacting your local TAC. Keep in mind, many questions can be answered CAUTION ! 81 on IRS.gov without visiting a TAC. Go to IRS.gov/LetUsHelp for the topics peo- ple ask about most. If you still need help, TACs provide tax help when a tax issue can’t be handled online or by phone. All TACs now provide service by appointment, so you’ll know in advance that you can get the service you need without long wait times. Before you vis- it, go to IRS.gov/TACLocator to find the nearest TAC and to check hours, availa- ble services, and appointment options. Or, on the IRS2Go app, under the Stay Connected tab, choose the Contact Us option and click on “Local Offices.” Interest and Penalties You don’t have to figure the amount of any interest or penalties you may owe. We will send you a bill for any amount due. If you choose to include interest or penalties (other than the estimated tax penalty) with your payment, identify and enter the amount in the bottom margin of Form 1040 or 1040-SR, page 2. Don’t include interest or penalties (other than the estimated tax penalty) in the amount you owe on line 37. For more informa- tion on the estimated tax penalty, see Line 38, earlier. Interest We will charge you interest on taxes not paid by their due date, even if an exten- sion of time to file is granted. We will also charge you interest on penalties im- posed for failure to file, negligence, fraud, substantial or gross valuation mis- statements, substantial understatements of tax, and reportable transaction under- statements. Interest is charged on the penalty from the due date of the return (including extensions). Penalties Late filing. If you don’t file your return by the due date (including extensions), the penalty is usually 5% of the amount due for each month or part of a month your return is late, unless you have a reasonable explanation. If you have a reasonable explanation for filing late, in- clude it with your return. The penalty can be as much as 25% of the tax due. The penalty is 15% per month, up to a maximum of 75%, if the failure to file is fraudulent. If your return is more than 60 days late, the minimum penalty will be $510 or the amount of any tax you owe, whichever is smaller. Late payment of tax. If you pay your taxes late, the penalty is usually 1/2 of 1% of the unpaid amount for each month or part of a month the tax isn't paid. The penalty can be as much as 25% of the unpaid amount. It applies to any unpaid tax on the return. This penal- ty is in addition to interest charges on late payments. Frivolous return. In addition to any other penalties, the law imposes a penal- ty of $5,000 for filing a frivolous return. A frivolous return is one that doesn't contain information needed to figure the correct tax or shows a substantially in- correct tax because you take a frivolous position or desire to delay or interfere with the tax laws. This includes altering or striking out the preprinted language above the space where you sign. For a list of positions identified as frivolous, see Notice 2010-33, 2010-17 I.R.B. 609, available at IRS.gov/irb/ 2010-17_IRB#NOT-2010-33. Other. Other penalties can be imposed for, among other things, negligence, substantial understatement of tax, re- portable transaction understatements, fil- ing an erroneous refund claim, and fraud. Criminal penalties may be im- posed for willful failure to file, tax eva- sion, making a false statement, or identi- ty theft. See Pub. 17 for details on some of these penalties. 82 Refund Information To check the status of your refund, go to IRS.gov/Refunds or use the free IRS2Go app, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Information about your refund will generally be available within 24 hours after the IRS receives your e-filed return or 4 weeks after you mail a paper return. But if you filed Form 8379 with your return, allow 14 weeks (11 weeks if you filed electroni- cally) before checking your refund sta- tus. The IRS can’t issue refunds before mid-February 2025 for returns that claim the earned income credit or the additional child tax credit. This delay applies to the entire refund, not just the portion associated with these credits. To use Where's My Refund, have a copy of your tax return handy. You will need to enter the following information from your re- turn: • Your social security number (or in- dividual taxpayer identification num- ber), • Your filing status, and • The exact whole dollar amount of your refund. Where's My Refund will provide an actual personalized refund date as soon as the IRS processes your tax return and approves your refund. Updates to refund status are made once a day—usually at night. If you don’t have Internet ac- cess, you can call 800-829-1954, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for automated refund in- formation. Our phone and walk-in assis- tors can research the status of your re- fund only if it's been 21 days or more since you filed electronically or more than 6 weeks since you mailed your pa- per return. Don’t send in a copy of your return unless asked to do so. To get a refund, you must generally file your return within 3 years from the date the return was due (including exten- sions). Where's My Refund doesn't track re- funds that are claimed on an amended tax return. TIP Refund information is also available in Spanish at IRS.gov/Spanish and 800-829-1954. 83 Instructions for Schedule 1 Additional Income and Adjustments to Income General Instructions Use Schedule 1 to report income or ad- justments to income that can’t be en- tered directly on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. Additional income is entered on Schedule 1, Part I. The amount on line 10 of Schedule 1 is entered on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 8. Adjustments to income are entered on Schedule 1, Part II. The amount on line 26 is entered on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 10. Form(s) 1099-K If, for tax year 2024, you received a Form(s) 1099-K that shows payments that were included in error (for example, money for gifts or reimbursements) or for personal items that you sold at a loss (for example, an old refrigerator), enter the amount that was included in error or for personal items sold at a loss in the entry space at the top of Schedule 1. • If the entire amount reported to you on Form(s)1099-K was in error or for personal items sold at a loss, enter the total amount from Form(s) 1099-K, box 1(a), in the entry space at the top of Schedule 1. • If only some of the amount reported to you on Form(s) 1099-K in box 1(a) was in error or for personal items sold at a loss, only enter the amount that was in error or for personal items sold at a loss in the entry space at the top of Schedule 1. The remaining amounts reported to you on Form(s) 1099-K should be reported elsewhere on your return depending on the nature of the transactions. • If you received more than one incorrect Form(s) 1099-K, with amounts reported in error or for personal items sold at a loss, add the incorrect amounts together and enter the total incorrect amount in the entry space at the top of Schedule 1. The remaining amounts reported to you on Form(s) 1099-K in box 1(a) should be reported elsewhere on your return depending on the nature of the transactions. If you received a Form 1099-K for a personal item that you sold at a gain, don't report this amount in the entry space at the top of Schedule 1; instead report it as you would report any other capital gain on Form 8949 and Schedule D. Example–Incorrect Form 1099-K. You received a Form 1099-K that incor- rectly showed $800 of payments to you in box 1(a). You would enter $800 in the entry space at the top of Schedule 1. Example–Personal item sold at a loss. You bought a couch for $1,000 and sold it through a third-party vendor for $700, which was reported in box 1(a) of your Form 1099-K. You would enter $700 in the entry space at the top of Schedule 1. Example–Personal items sold at a loss and a gain. In addition to selling your couch for $700, you also sold a handbag that you bought for $800 and sold for $1,200. Your Form 1099-K shows $1,900 in box 1(a). You would enter $700 in the entry space at the top of Schedule 1 for your loss on selling the couch and the remaining $400 of gain from the sale of the handbag would be reported as capital gain on Form 8949 and Schedule D. Example–Multiple incorrect Form(s) 1099-K. You received a Form 1099-K that incorrectly showed $800 of payments to you in box 1(a). You also received a Form 1099-K that reported $6,000 in box 1(a) but $700 of that amount was reported in error. You would enter $1,500 in the entry space at the top of Schedule 1. The remaining $5,300 should be reported elsewhere on your return depending on the nature of the transactions. TIP Additional Income Line 1 Taxable Refunds, Credits, or Offsets of State and Local Income Taxes None of your refund is taxable if, in the year you paid the tax, you either (a) didn't itemize de- ductions, or (b) elected to deduct state and local general sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes. If you received a refund, credit, or offset of state or local income taxes in 2024, you may be required to report this amount. If you didn't receive a Form 1099-G, check with the government agency that made the payments to you. Your 2024 Form 1099-G may have been made available to you only in an elec- tronic format, and you will need to get instructions from the agency to retrieve this document. Report any taxable re- fund you received even if you didn't re- ceive Form 1099-G. If you chose to apply part or all of the refund to your 2024 estimated state or local income tax, the amount applied is treated as received in 2024. If the refund was for a tax you paid in 2023 and you deducted state and local income taxes on your 2023 Schedule A, use the State and Local Income Tax Refund Worksheet in these instructions to see if any of your refund is taxable. Exception. See Itemized Deduction Re- coveries in Pub. 525 instead of using the State and Local Income Tax Refund Worksheet in these instructions if any of the following applies. 1. You received a refund in 2024 that is for a tax year other than 2023. 2. You received a refund other than an income tax refund, such as a general sales tax or real property tax refund, in 2024 of an amount deducted or credit claimed in an earlier year. TIP 84 3. You had taxable income on your 2023 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 15, but no tax on your Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 16, because of the 0% tax rate on net capital gain and qualified dividends in certain situations. 4. Your 2023 state and local income tax refund is more than your 2023 state and local income tax deduction minus the amount you could have deducted as your 2023 state and local general sales taxes. 5. You made your last payment of 2023 estimated state or local income tax in 2024. 6. You owed alternative minimum tax in 2023. 7. You couldn't use the full amount of credits you were entitled to in 2023 because the total credits were more than the amount shown on your 2023 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 16. 8. You could be claimed as a de- pendent by someone else in 2023. 9. You received a refund because of a jointly filed state or local income tax return, but you aren't filing a joint 2024 Form 1040 or 1040-SR with the same person. Lines 2a and 2b Alimony Received Line 2a Enter amounts received as alimony or separate maintenance pursuant to a di- vorce or separation agreement entered into on or before December 31, 2018, unless that agreement was changed after December 31, 2018, to expressly pro- vide that alimony received isn't included in your income. Alimony received is not included in your income if you entered into a divorce or separation agreement after December 31, 2018. If you are in- cluding alimony in your income, you must let the person who made the pay- ments know your social security num- ber. If you don’t, you may have to pay a penalty. For more details, see Pub. 504. If you are including alimony pay- ments from more than one divorce or separation agreement in your income, enter the total of all alimony received on line 2a. Line 2b On line 2b, enter the month and year of your original divorce or separation agreement that relates to the alimony payment, if any, reported on line 2a. If you have alimony payments from more than one divorce or separation agreement, on line 2b enter the month and year of the divorce or separation agreement for which you received the most income. Attach a statement listing the month and year of the other agree- ments. Line 3 Business Income or (Loss) If you operated a business or practiced your profession as a sole proprietor, re- port your income and expenses on Schedule C. Line 4 Other Gains or (Losses) If you sold or exchanged assets used in a trade or business, see the Instructions for Form 4797. Line 7 Unemployment Compensation You should receive a Form 1099-G showing in box 1 the total unemploy- ment compensation paid to you in 2024. Report this amount on line 7. If the amount reported in box 1 of your Form(s) 1099-G is in- correct, report on line 7 only the actual amount of unemployment compensation paid to you in 2024. If you made contributions to a gov- ernmental unemployment compensation program or to a governmental paid fami- ly leave program and you aren't itemiz- ing deductions, reduce the amount you report on line 7 by those contributions. If you are itemizing deductions, see the instructions on Form 1099-G. If you received an overpayment of unemployment compensation in 2024 and you repaid any of it in 2024, sub- tract the amount you repaid from the to- tal amount you received. Enter the result on line 7. Also enter “Repaid” and the amount you repaid on the dotted line next to line 7. If, in 2024, you repaid more than $3,000 of unemployment CAUTION ! compensation that you included in gross income in an earlier year, see Repay- ments in Pub. 525 for details on how to report the payment. If you received unemployment compensation in 2024, your state may issue an electronic Form 1099-G instead of it being mailed to you. Check your state's unemployment compensation website for more informa- tion. Lines 8a Through 8z Other Income Do not report on lines 8a through 8z any income from self-employment or fees re- ceived as a notary public.

Use Tax Topic 455 or see Form 3903. Line 15 Deductible Part of Self-Employment Tax If you were self-employed and owe self-employment tax, fill in Schedule SE to figure the amount of your deduction. The deductible part of your self-employ- ment tax is on line 13 of Schedule SE. Line 16 Self-Employed SEP, SIMPLE, and Qualified Plans If you were self-employed or a partner, you may be able to take this deduction. See Pub. 560 or, if you were a minister, Pub. 517. Line 17 Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction You may be able to deduct the amount you paid for health insurance (which in- cludes medical, dental, and vision insur- ance and qualified long-term care insur- ance) for yourself, your spouse, and your dependents. The insurance can also cover your child who was under age 27 at the end of 2024, even if the child wasn't your dependent. A child includes your son, daughter, stepchild, adopted child, or foster child (defined in Who Qualifies as Your Dependent in the In- structions for Form 1040). One of the following statements must be true. • You were self-employed and had a net profit for the year reported on Schedule C or F. • You were a partner with net earn- ings from self-employment. • You used one of the optional meth- ods to figure your net earnings from self-employment on Schedule SE. • You received wages in 2024 from an S corporation in which you were a more-than-2% shareholder. Health insur- ance premiums paid or reimbursed by the S corporation are shown as wages on Form W-2. The insurance plan must be establish- ed under your business. Your personal services must have been a material in- come-producing factor in the business. If you are filing Schedule C or F, the policy can be either in your name or in the name of the business. If you are a partner, the policy can be either in your name or in the name of the partnership. You can either pay the pre- miums yourself or your partnership can pay them and report them as guaranteed payments. If the policy is in your name and you pay the premiums yourself, the partnership must reimburse you and re- port the premiums as guaranteed pay- ments. 89 If you are a more-than-2% sharehold- er in an S corporation, the policy can be either in your name or in the name of the S corporation. You can either pay the premiums yourself or the S corporation can pay them and report them as wages. If the policy is in your name and you pay the premiums yourself, the S corpo- ration must reimburse you. You can de- duct the premiums only if the S corpora- tion reports the premiums paid or reim- bursed as wages in box 1 of your Form W-2 in 2024 and you also report the pre- mium payments or reimbursements as wages on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1a. But if you were also eligible to par- ticipate in any subsidized health plan maintained by your or your spouse's em- ployer for any month or part of a month in 2024, amounts paid for health insur- ance coverage for that month can't be used to figure the deduction. Also, if you were eligible for any month or part of a month to participate in any subsi- dized health plan maintained by the em- ployer of either your dependent or your child who was under age 27 at the end of 2024, don’t use amounts paid for cov- erage for that month to figure the deduc- tion. A qualified small employer health reimbursement arrange- ment (QSEHRA) is considered to be a subsidized health plan main- tained by an employer. Example. If you were eligible to par- ticipate in a subsidized health plan main- tained by your spouse's employer from September 30 through December 31, you can't use amounts paid for health in- surance coverage for September through December to figure your deduction. Medicare premiums you voluntarily pay to obtain insurance in your name that is similar to qualifying private health insurance can be used to figure the deduction. Amounts paid for health insurance coverage from retirement plan distributions that were nontaxable be- cause you are a retired public safety offi- cer can't be used to figure the deduction. For more details, see Instructions for Form 7206. If you qualify to take the deduction, use the Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction Worksheet to figure the amount you can deduct. Exceptions. Use Form 7206 instead of the Self-Employed Health Insurance De- duction Worksheet in these instructions to figure your deduction if any of the following applies.

You are entitled to a deduction for your contribution to a tradi- tional IRA regardless of age. If you made contributions to a tradi- tional IRA for 2024, you may be able to take an IRA deduction. But you, or your spouse if filing a joint return, must have had earned income to do so. For IRA purposes, earned income includes alimo- ny and separate maintenance payments reported on Schedule 1, line 2a. If you were a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, earned income includes any non- taxable combat pay you received. If you were self-employed, earned income is generally your net earnings from self-employment if your personal serv- ices were a material income-producing factor. For more details, see Pub. 590-A. A statement should be sent to you by June 2, 2025, that shows all contribu- tions to your traditional IRA for 2024. Use the IRA Deduction Worksheet to figure the amount, if any, of your IRA TIP TIP deduction. But read the following list before you fill in the worksheet. 1. You can't deduct contributions to a Roth IRA. But you may be able to take the retirement savings contributions credit (saver's credit). See the instruc- tions for Schedule 3, line 4. 2. If you are filing a joint return and you or your spouse made contributions to both a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA for 2024, don’t use the IRA Deduction Worksheet in these instructions. Instead, see Pub. 590-A to figure the amount, if any, of your IRA deduction. 3. You can’t deduct elective defer- rals to a 401(k) plan, 403(b) plan, sec- tion 457 plan, SIMPLE IRA plan, or the federal Thrift Savings Plan.

Were You Covered by a Retirement Plan? If you were covered by a retirement plan (qualified pension, profit-sharing (in- cluding 401(k)), annuity, SEP, SIMPLE, etc.) at work or through self-employ- ment, your IRA deduction may be re- duced or eliminated. But you can still make contributions to an IRA even if you can't deduct them. In any case, the income earned on your IRA contribu- tions isn't taxed until it is paid to you. The “Retirement plan” box in box 13 of your Form W-2 should be checked if you were covered by a plan at work even if you weren’t vested in the plan. You are also covered by a plan if you were self-employed and had a SEP, SIMPLE, or qualified retirement plan. If you were covered by a retirement plan and you file Form 2555 or 8815, or you exclude employer-provided adop- tion benefits, see Pub. 590-A to figure the amount, if any, of your IRA deduc- tion.

We must also tell you what could happen if we do not receive it and whether your response is voluntary, required to obtain a benefit, or mandatory under the law. This notice applies to all records and other material (in paper or electronic for- mat) you file with us, including this tax return. It also applies to any questions we need to ask you so we can complete, cor- rect, or process your return; figure your tax; and collect tax, interest, or penalties. Our legal right to ask for information is Internal Revenue Code sections 6001, 6011, and 6012(a), and their regulations. They say that you must file a return or statement with us for any tax you are lia- ble for. Your response is mandatory under these sections. Code section 6109 re- quires you to provide your identifying number on the return. This is so we know who you are, and can process your return and other papers. You must fill in all parts of the tax form that apply to you. But you do not have to check the boxes for the Presidential Election Campaign Fund or for the third-party designee. You also do not have to provide your daytime phone number or email address. You are not required to provide the in- formation requested on a form that is sub- ject to the Paperwork Reduction Act un- less the form displays a valid OMB con- trol number. Books or records relating to a form or its instructions must be retained as long as their contents may become ma- terial in the administration of any Internal Revenue law. We ask for tax return information to carry out the tax laws of the United States. We need it to figure and collect the right amount of tax. If you do not file a return, do not pro- vide the information we ask for, or pro- vide fraudulent information, you may be charged penalties and be subject to crimi- nal prosecution. We may also have to dis- allow the exemptions, exclusions, credits, deductions, or adjustments shown on the tax return. This could make the tax higher or delay any refund. Interest may also be charged. Generally, tax returns and return infor- mation are confidential, as stated in Code section 6103. However, Code section 6103 allows or requires the Internal Reve- nue Service to disclose or give the infor- mation shown on your tax return to others as described in the Code. For example, we may disclose your tax information to the Department of Justice to enforce the tax laws, both civil and criminal, and to cities, states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. commonwealths or territories to carry out their tax laws. We may disclose your tax information to the Department of Treasury and contractors for tax adminis- tration purposes; and to other persons as necessary to obtain information needed to determine the amount of or to collect the tax you owe. We may disclose your tax information to the Comptroller General of the United States to permit the Comptrol- ler General to review the Internal Reve- nue Service. We may disclose your tax in- formation to committees of Congress; federal, state, and local child support agencies; and to other federal agencies for the purposes of determining entitlement for benefits or the eligibility for and the repayment of loans. We may also disclose this information to other countries under a tax treaty, to federal and state agencies to enforce federal nontax criminal laws, or to federal law enforcement and intelli- gence agencies to combat terrorism. Please keep this notice with your re- cords. It may help you if we ask you for other information. If you have questions about the rules for filing and giving infor- mation, please call or visit any Internal Revenue Service office. We Welcome Comments on Forms We try to create forms and instructions that can be easily understood. Often this is difficult to do because our tax laws are very complex. For some people with in- come mostly from wages, filling in the forms is easy. For others who have busi- nesses, pensions, stocks, rental income, or other investments, it is more difficult. If you have suggestions for making these forms simpler, we would be happy to hear from you. You can send us com- ments through IRS.gov/FormsComments. Or you can send your comments to Inter- nal Revenue Service, Tax Forms and Pub- lications Division, 1111 Constitution Ave. NW, IR-6526, Washington, DC 20224. Don’t send your return to this address. In- stead, see the addresses at the end of these instructions. Although we can't respond individual- ly to each comment received, we do ap- preciate your feedback and will consider your comments as we revise our tax forms and instructions. Estimates of Taxpayer Burden The following table shows burden esti- mates based on current statutory require- ments as of December 1, 2024, for tax- payers filing a 2024 Form 1040 or 1040-SR tax return. Time spent and out-of-pocket costs are presented sepa- rately. Time burden is broken out by tax- payer activity, with recordkeeping repre- senting the largest component. Out-of-pocket costs include any expenses incurred by taxpayers to prepare and sub- mit their tax returns. Examples include tax return preparation and submission fees, postage and photocopying costs, and tax return preparation software costs. While these estimates don’t include bur- den associated with post-filing activities, IRS operational data indicate that elec- tronically prepared and filed returns have fewer arithmetic errors, implying lower post-filing burden. Reported time and cost burdens are na- tional averages and don’t necessarily re- flect a “typical” case. Most taxpayers ex- perience lower than average burden, with taxpayer burden varying considerably by taxpayer type. For instance, the estimated average time burden for all taxpayers fil- ing a Form 1040 or 1040-SR is 13 hours, with an average cost of $290 per return. This average includes all associated forms and schedules, across all tax return prepa- ration methods and taxpayer activities. Within this estimate, there is signifi- cant variation in taxpayer activity. For ex- ample, nonbusiness taxpayers are expec- ted to have an average burden of about 8 hours and $160, while business taxpayers are expected to have an average burden of about 24 hours and $620. Similarly, tax return preparation fees and other out-of-pocket costs vary extensively de- 106 pending on the tax situation of the taxpay- er, the type of software or professional preparer used, and the geographic loca- tion. For more information on taxpayer bur- den see Pub. 5743. If you have comments concerning the time and cost estimates below, you can contact us at either one of the addresses shown under We Welcome Comments on Forms.

These pie charts show the relative sizes of the major categories of federal income and outlays for ﬁscal year 2023. Social security, Medicare, and unemployment and other retirement taxes 26% Personal income taxes 35% Borrowing to cover deﬁcit 28% Corporate income taxes 7% Excise, customs, estate, gift, and miscellaneous taxes 4% *Numbers may not total to 100% due to rounding. Social programs4 23% Physical, human, and community development3 7% Net interest on the debt 11% Social security, Medicare, and other retirement1 39% National defense, veterans, and foreign affairs2 19% Law enforcement and general government 2% On or before the first Monday in February of each year, the President is required by law to submit to the Congress a budget proposal for the fiscal year that begins the following October. The budget plan sets forth the President's proposed receipts, spending, and the surplus or deficit for the federal government. The plan includes recommendations for new legislation as well as recommendations to change, elim- inate, and add programs. After receipt of the President's proposal, the Congress re- views the proposal and makes changes. It first passes a budget resolution setting its own targets for receipts, outlays, and sur- plus or deficit. Next, individual spending and revenue bills that are consistent with the goals of the budget resolution are enacted. In fiscal year 2023 (which began on October 1, 2022, and ended on September 30, 2023, federal income was $4.441 tril- lion and outlays were $6.135 trillion, leaving a deficit of $1.694 trillion. Footnotes for Certain Federal Outlays 1. Social security, Medicare, and other retirement: These programs pro- vide income support for the retired and disabled and medical care for the elderly. 2. National defense, veterans, and foreign affairs: About 13% of outlays were to equip, modernize, and pay our armed forces and to fund national defense activities; about 5% were for veterans benefits and services; and about 1% were for international activities, including mili- tary and economic assistance to foreign countries and the maintenance of U.S. embassies abroad. 3. Physical, human, and communi- ty development: These outlays were for agriculture; natural resources; environ- ment; transportation; aid for elementary and secondary education and direct assis- tance to college students; job training; de- posit insurance, commerce and housing credit, and community development; and space, energy, and general science pro- grams. 4. Social programs: About 17% of total outlays were for Medicaid, Supple- mental Nutrition Assistance Program (for- merly food stamps), temporary assistance for needy families, supplemental security income, and related programs; and 6% for health research and public health pro- grams, unemployment compensation, as- sisted housing, and social services. Note. The percentages shown here exclude undistributed offsetting receipts, which were $132 billion in fiscal year 2023. In the budget, these receipts are offset against spending in figuring the outlay totals shown above. These receipts are for the U.S. Government's share of its employee retirement programs, rents and royalties on the Outer Continental Shelf, and proceeds from the sale of assets. 108 731,200 2024 Tax Rate Schedules The Tax Rate Schedules are shown so you can see the tax rate that applies to all levels of taxable income.
